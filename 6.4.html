      </h3>
      <div class="pad">
        <p>
          You've learned a lot over the last six weeks! Including a number of foundational Art Historical skills:
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>
            carefully observing images and objects of many different styles and mediums;
          </li>
          <li>
            using formal analysis skills to understand how artworks are made and read;
          </li>
          <li>
            identifying and describing the relevant qualities of artworks, independently and in comparison with others;
          </li>
          <li>
            understanding relevant themes and theories surrounding the interpretation of artworks.
          </li>
        </ul>     
        <p>
          You've also seen and learned about works from every hemisphere of the globe, from antiquity to the present, across radically different styles and cultures.

          "So, what do I do with these skills?""
        </h5>
        <p>
          While many of you may never take another Art History course again, (<a href="6.1.html#courses">a friendly reminder, though, there's plenty of options!</a>), all of you possess key skills to be discerning art viewers. You are not just members of the art-appreciating public, you now have valuable tools and know-how with which to engage more deeply with art. 
        </p>
        <p>
          With that in mind, I am ending this course with a short list of exhibitions and events you can visit in the months following this course. I encourage you to apply and develop the skills you've learned by exploring the range of art on display in Toronto. May you go forth and appreciate art!

          Moments in Modernism highlights the diversity and high quality of the AGO‚Äôs modern art collection, which has been built over time by generations of museum curators and patrons. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This installation will show collection strengths from artistic movements such as Pop Art, Abstraction, Realism, and Minimalism.  An international approach in artistic styles will be presented, including a body of work from the AGO holdings by Brazilian artists, recognizing the global nature of modernism. A selection of contemporary works that respond to modernist movements will also be shown. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of the artists, including Andy Warhol, Helen Frankenthaler, Jules Olitski, Gerhard Richter, and Mark Rothko are well known while others are still yet to be broadly recognized such as Tomie Ohtake, Rubem Valentim, Gene Davis and Kazuo Nakamura. A particular focus will be Canadian artists including Alex Colville, Rita Letendre, Jack Bush, Agnes Martin, Guido Molinari and Norval Morrisseau.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moments in Modernism features artworks that will form the cornerstone for the expansion of the new Dani Reiss Modern and Contemporary Gallery, starting construction in 2024.  The new building is being designed by architects Diamond Schmitt, Selldorf Architects and Two Row Architect to showcase the AGO's growing collection of modern and contemporary art.

Featuring works by Leasho Johnson, Marie-H√©l√®ne Cauvin, Sahara Longe, Myrlande Constant, Che Lovelace, and Marc Padeu, this installation illustrates their distinct ways of expressing a multiplicity of histories, contested identities and cultural perspectives. The broad range of visual tropes and subjects in these works offer a glimpse into the multifaceted contemporary experiences of Africa and its diasporas, and the complexities of Black life.

        This fall will see the third edition of Toronto's biennial (i.e. happening every two years) contemporary art fair, featuring the work of 23 artists, displayed across ten venues across the city. This year's edition takes as its theme <strong>Precarious Joy</strong>, which I think describes the bizarre experience of making the most of the unstable times we're hurtling through.

          How the curators describe it:
        </strong>
      </p>
      <em>
        <p>
          For the third edition of the Toronto Biennial of Art (TBA), titled Precarious Joys, we have been immersed in dialogues and active listening, a crucial element in our curatorial journey traversing national and international landscapes, numerous artist studios, and art encounters in Toronto, throughout Canada, and beyond. Our interactions have traced connections between artistic creations reflecting social and ecological imperatives, resulting in us identifying key directives drawn from the artists‚Äô endeavours: ‚ÄúJoy,‚Äù ‚ÄúPrecarious,‚Äù ‚ÄúHome,‚Äù ‚ÄúPolyphony,‚Äù ‚ÄúSolace,‚Äù and ‚ÄúCoded‚Äù are terms that encapsulate how TBA artists‚Äô practices amplify political consciousness and reassert the power of aesthetics in shaping collective existence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the presented artworks address the various layers of history that define life in Toronto, while others reflect broader social and political structures of inequality and power under global neoliberal governance. Key issues that resonate across the exhibition include environmental justice, sovereignty, self-representation, belonging and migration, land dispossession, collective memory, feminist genealogies, diasporic sonic cultures, sacred plant wisdom, weaving as spiritual listening, resistance and resilience, ancestorship, and queer worldmaking. Rather than presenting a single theoretical assertion, however, Precarious Joys is organized around open dialogues and poetic connections. Together, these many works will conjure sparks that light a fire amidst the fragility of existence.

The art world, which once unjustly neglected these mediums, has only recently been catching up with their rich and important history.
