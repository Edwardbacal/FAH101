        What is a compare and contrast analysis?
      </h3>
      
      <p>
        A distinctive kind of art-history question is the comparison (compare and contrast). In a compare and contrast, two slides are shown and students are asked to compare and contrast the images&mdash;to discuss the similarities and differences between them. This kind of question may ask you to discuss two images within a culture or period, or images across cultures or periods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your instructor may provide a specific question to answer, or you may have to determine the important issues raised by the juxtaposition of the two images. It&rsquo;s important to spend time thinking and outlining your answer before you begin to write, especially when there is no question provided. You want to make sure that you're focusing on the central issue presented by the pairing of the two images. Pairings aren't random&mdash;usually your instructor is prompting you to discuss an important theme or issue in the course.
      </p>
      <p>
        A mistake a lot of students make in comparisons is simply describing one image and then the other without ever relating the two. Make sure you're discussing the similarities and differences between them. Words like "similarly," "unlike," "both," "in contrast," and "while" are good clues that you're developing a strong comparative essay. As with a thematic essay, the conclusion should summarize your argument and present any final thoughts.

            Recap:

          The goal of a compare and contrast analysis is to make a point - demonstrate a thesis - about two works considered together. You are not merely making two lists. You will introduce the comparison with a thesis sentence.

        Compare and Contrast Analysis Organization
      </h3>
      <div class="pad" style="margin: 4rem 0;">
        <p>
          We can call the two ways of organizing a compare and contrast <strong>block-by-block</strong> (or lumping) and <strong>point-by-point</strong> (or splitting).
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether organizing by lumping or by splitting will depend largely on your purpose and on the complexity of the material. Lumping is often used for long, complex comparisons, if for no other reason than to avoid the ping-pong effect, but no hard-and-fast rule covers all cases here. When you offer an extended comparison, it is advisable to begin by indicating your focus, that is, by defining the main issue or problem and also by indicating what your principle of organization will be in the introduction.

          After introducing the two works in the intro paragraph, write a full description and analysis of each work, separately.
        </p>
        <p>
          After establishing the key traits and qualities of the two works (once the reader has a strong sense of what each work looks like and understands its formal qualities), bring both works together to compare the two examples.

          After introducing the two works in the intro paragraph, describe and analyze the two works together.

            Block-by-Block (Lumping)
          </h4>
          <p>
            When you compare block-by-block, you say what you have to say about one artwork in a block or lump, and then you go on to discuss the second artwork, in another block or lump.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a lumping structure would be as follows:
          </p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              Thesis about the Buddha and the bodhisattva
            </li>
            <li>
              The Buddha (posture, folds of garments, inner nature)
            </li>
            <li>
              The bodhisattva (posture, folds of garments, inner nature)
            </li>
            <li>
              The Buddha and the bodhisattva (synthesis)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you lump, do not simply comment first on X and then on Y.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let your reader know where you are going, probably by means of an introductory sentence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't be afraid in the second half to remind the reader of the first half. It is legitimate, even desirable, to connect the second half of the comparison (chiefly concerned with Y) to the first half (chiefly concerned with X). Thus, you will probably say things like "Unlike X, Y show&hellip;" or "Although Y superficially resembles X in such-and-such, when looked at closely Y shows&hellip;" In short, a comparison organized by lumping will not break into two separate halves if the second half develops by reminding the reader how it differs from the first half.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="inv pad">
          <h4>
            Point-by-Point (Splitting)
          </h4>
          <p>
            When you compare point-by-point, however, you split up your discussion of each work, more or less interweaving your comments on the two things being compared, perhaps in alternating paragraphs, or even in alternating sentences.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a splitting structure would be as follows:
          </p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              Thesis about the Buddha and the bodhisattva
            </li>
            <li>
              The Buddha (posture)
            </li>
            <li>
              The bodhisattva (posture)
            </li>
            <li>
              The Buddha (garments)
            </li>
            <li>
              The bodhisattva (garments)
            </li>
            <li>
              The Buddha and the bodhisattva (synthesis)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Splitting is well suited to short essays or for occasional use within longer essays, but if it is relentlessly used as the organizing principle of a longer essay, it is likely to produce a ping-pong effect. The essay may not come into focus&mdash;the reader may not grasp the point&mdash;until the writer stands back from the seven-layer cake and announces, in the concluding paragraph, that the odd layers taste better.
          </p>
          <p>
            In your preparatory thinking, splitting probably will help you to get certain characteristics clear in your mind, but you must come to some conclusions about what these add up to before writing the final version. The final version should not duplicate the preliminary thought processes; rather, since the point of a comparison is to make a point, it should be organized so as to make the point clearly and effectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you split, in rereading your draft:
          </p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              Ask yourself if your imagined reader can keep up with the back-and-forth movement. Make sure (perhaps by a summary sentence at the end) that the larger picture is not obscured by the zigzagging.
            </li>
            <li>
              Don't leave any loose ends. Make sure that if you call attention to points 1, 2, and 3 in X, you mention all of them (not just 1 and 2) in Y.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        Common Writing Pitfalls
      </h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Writing takes practice.</strong> You can't become a good writer without writing&mdash;a lot. Learning how to write in the style of a particular academic discipline isn't easy, because each discipline has its own distinctive way of researching, structuring arguments, and presenting evidence. Writing as an art historian will teach you to look carefully (through close looking and reading), argue logically (e.g., through a compare and contrast analysis), and think originally. Remember that in the end all writing, not just fiction or poetry, is a creative process.

              Usually, <strong>paragraphs that are take up most of a page (or more)</strong> are a sign the arguments are muddled and you are trying to make more than one point at a time. You can probably restructure a very long paragraph as two or more.

              Developing a List of Similarities and Differences
            </h4>
            <p>
              The first step in writing a compare and contrast analysis is developing a list of similarities and differences. I often brainstorm the similarities and differences by drawing a Venn diagram or using a table (refer to examples on the <a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/comparing-and-contrasting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Writing Center website</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
              In our course, we are comparing the two objects (refer to the "<a href="#writing">Writing Your Compare and Contrast Analysis Paper</a>" section below). Use the following questions to help you start developing a list of similarities and differences:
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
              <li>
                What is the topic of each object? What details are included in each object?
              </li>
              <li>
                How do the formal elements guide the viewing experience?
              </li>
              <li>
                What are the materials and sizes of each object?
              </li>
              <li>
                What are the contexts (if known) of each object? (Recall the 5Ws and 1H)
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

              Developing a Thesis
            </h4>
            <p>
              After developing a list of similarities and differences, determine what is interesting, important, and relevant in the context of the course/assignment. Identify how the similarities and differences create an argument about the two paintings. Do the similarities outweigh the differences and vice versa? The University of Toronto Writing Centre offers a helpful resource on <a href="https://advice.writing.utoronto.ca/planning/thesis-statements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using thesis statements</a>.

          Compare and Contrast Analysis Samples
        </h3>
        <p>
          The compare and contrast of two portraits of Pocahontas video (hyperlinked above) offers a strong example of how to conduct a compare and contrast analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take a look at this <a href="./assets/04/Compare and Contrast Analysis Sample.pdf" target="_blank">compare and contrast analysis sample</a> and consider how the author is organizing their compare and contrast (page 8.3). For our compare and contrast analysis, I encourage you to dive into the compare and contrast analysis without the personal narrative opening paragraph. Try outlining your own analysis paper to ensure that each paragraph of your analysis saying and doing something with the help of an effective structure. <strong>Please note that the sample PDF is not the same as our assignment in format and research requirements.</strong>

            <p>
              In the opening paragraph, you will include:
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
              <li>
                The name of the artist (if known), title (which is <em>italicized</em> every time you use the title in your paper), date, and medium (if known) for both objects you are comparing and contrasting.
              </li>
              <li>
                What you think is the subject of each object.
              </li>
              <li>
                Thesis statement (usually the last line or so of your first paragraph).

              From that point, the rest of the compare and contrast analysis should include not only a description of each object but especially those details of the work that have led you to come to your thesis. The goal of a compare and contrast analysis is to make a point, argue a thesis. You are not merely making two lists. You are relating the two objects to one another and addressing questions such as:
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
              <li>
                Why should these two objects be compared and contrasted?
              </li>
              <li>
                How does comparing and contrasting the two objects reveal additional insights about each object?
              </li>
              <li>
                Why has each artist used formal elements in a particular way?
              </li>
              <li>
                How has such strategies uses guided and affected your viewing experience?

              As with your formal analysis, the final paragraph should summarize your argument (i.e., a restatement of your thesis) and present any final thoughts.
