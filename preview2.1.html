        What is a <em>formal analysis?</em>
      </h3>
      
      <h4>
        At its root, it's an examination of the forms (visual elements and qualities) that are discernible in an artwork or object. What an artwork looks like – including the ways it's made to look like it does – matters! These forms not only define the work's visual character, they also give it its expression, message, and meaning.
      </h4>
      
      <p>
        
        A formal analysis assumes a work of art <em>is a purposefully made object,</em> which has been created with a stable meaning</em> (even though it might not be clear to the viewer), and the meaning or character of the work can be <em>ascertained by studying the relationships between the work's visual elements and qualities.</em>
      </p>

        <li class="pad flex">
          <p>
            Imagine describing a work of art to someone who has never seen it before (assume they can't see it or look up a picture of it). By reading your formal analysis, that person should have a complete mental picture of what the work looks like.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      
      <p>
        Yet, the formal analysis is more than just a description, it makes a claim about the work, it says something about how its visual elements and qualities are constructed and what effects they have. A formal analysis needs a <em>thesis statement</em> that reflects your conclusions about the work. This statement is like the key takeaway of your analysis and is crucial because it establishes the tone for the entire paper and sets it apart from being just a plain description.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, think about what effect these visual properties have on you as a viewer. How does the work direct your attention? How does it guide you through the work, or communicate something to you? Even the subtle things matter. To cite a non-art, non-human example, there's a viral trend I love of dogs watching Bluey, an animated kids shows about a family of dogs. Dogs are colourblind, but the animators included tones that dogs can perceive - so there's loads of videos of dogs watching it, absorbed, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@griffinfrenchie/video/7271265511835585794" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even having a moment 🥹</a> Think about how one formal element - colour - totally changes how these viewers engage with the image, not because they understand what's going on, but are literally seeing it in a way that affects their attention and emotions.

          A formal analysis is <em>not</em> concerned with explaining the symbolic interpretation or historical meaning of a work. It is first and foremost an exercise in close-looking, and you may have to resist the urge to jump to interpreting what the artwork means. A visual examination of the work is the starting point for unpacking how the work's effects, meaning, and expression are constructed by understanding how the work is <em>visually constructed.</em>

          <p>
            In short: to explain how the formal elements (the visual forms and stylistic qualities and effects) of an artwork affect the representation of the subject matter and expressive content. Here, the emphasis is on <em>analyzing the formal elements</em>, not conducting research or doing interpretation of symbolism or historical background.

            Writing a thesis for a formal analysis:
          </h4>
          
          <p>
            Here, a thesis statement should provides a framework for your analysis while suggesting your interpretation of the work. A thesis does not necessarily involve a statement of argument or original insight but should let the reader know how the artist's formal choices affect the viewer.

              Space is the area between and around objects. The space around objects is often called negative space; negative space has shape. Space can also refer to the feeling of depth. Real space is three-dimensional; in visual art, when we create the feeling or illusion of depth, we call it space.

              Colour is light reflected off of objects. Colour has three main characteristics: hue (the name of the colour, such as red, green, blue, etc.), value (how light or dark it is), and intensity (how bright or dull it is).
            </p>
            <ul class="list" style="margin-top: -.5rem;">
              <li>
                White is pure light; black is the absence of light.
              </li> 
              <li>
                Primary colours are the only true colours (red, blue, and yellow). All other
              </li> colours are mixes of primary colours. 
              <li>
                Secondary colours are two primary colours mixed together (green, orange,
              </li> violet). 
              <li>
                Intermediate colours, sometimes called tertiary colours, are made by mixing a primary and secondary colour together. Some examples of intermediate colours are yellow green, blue green, and blue violet. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Complementary colours are located directly across from each other on the colour wheel (an arrangement of colours along a circular diagram to show how they are related to one another). Complementary pairs contrast because they share no common colours. For example, red and green are complements, because green is made of blue and yellow. When comple- mentary colours are mixed together, they neutralize each other to make brown.

              Texture is the surface quality that can be seen and felt. Textures can be rough or smooth, soft or hard. Textures do not always feel the way they look; for exam- ple, a drawing of a porcupine may look prickly, but if you touch the drawing, the paper is still smooth.

              Emphasis is the part of the design that catches the viewer’s attention. Usually the artist will make one area stand out by contrasting it with other areas. The area couldbe different in size, color, texture, shape, etc.

              Balance is the distribution of the visual weight of objects, colors, texture, and space. If the design was a scale, these elements should be balanced to make a design feel stable. In symmetrical balance, the elements used on one side of the design aresimilar to those on the other side; in asymmetrical balance, the sides are different but still look balanced. In radial balance, the elements are arranged around a centralpoint and may be similar.

              Movement is the path the viewer’s eye takes through the work of art, often to focal areas. Such movement can be directed along lines, edges, shape, and color within thework of art.

              Rhythm is created when one or more elements of design are used repeatedly to
              create a feeling of organized movement. Rhythm creates a mood like music or
              dancing. To keep rhythm exciting and active, variety is essential.

        How do I start writing a formal analysis?  
      </h3>
      
      <p>
        Formal analysis papers help you develop the ability to examine works in a sustained and analytical way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep in mind that formal analysis does not mean producing a long, minute description of the artwork. Instead, you're trying to see how far you can interpret the image without consulting outside sources beyond the basic facts of identification.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your formal analysis needs to be based on a process of <strong>sustained looking</strong>. This can be a challenge. Our education and culture don't train us to do this, so it helps to have a systematic procedure. When you're standing in front of a work it's easy to think that you'll remember all the details of it when you get back to your desk. Unfortunately, that too rarely proves to be true, so you need to incorporate thorough note-taking practice into the process of looking.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll share my working method here, but remember that you'll have to adapt it to work for you. The first thing I do is sit down in front of the piece and spend some time just looking at it, absorbing the different aspects of it without writing anything down. I try to pay attention to visual aspects of the piece that jump out at me immediately, as well as those that take time to engage my attention. If you're working with sculpture or an installation, move around it and look at it from different angles.
      </p>
      <p>
        After you've looked for a while (at least 15 minutes), start <strong>taking notes</strong> about the piece. Write a detailed, systematic description of the work, noting its really striking features. When you've written down as much as you possibly can&mdash;this will easily take half an hour&mdash;go off and do something else. Get something to drink, look at some other works of art, browse the internet. Then, go back to the work and look at it again, another 15 minutes or so, without writing anything down. Be aware of features that emerge that you didn't see before. Then, take a whole new set of notes. At this point, a set of issues or themes, or a perspective should be taking shape. Go back over both sets of notes and see if you can clarify these ideas into a thesis statement, then be sure to have all the visual evidence you need to support that thesis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, <strong>draw the work</strong>. (Gasp, you've already done this for the previous assignment!) Even if you've downloaded the image, still draw it because it's a very effective way to engage your eye in careful looking. I do this when I'm researching: even if I take a dozen photographs of a piece I'm studying and write pages of formal analysis, I will draw it because that process enables me to see things I won't notice any other way. Don't get hung up on whether your drawing is "good" or not or whether you have any talent&mdash;this drawing is a working tool. The process may prompt other insights into the work, so be sure to write these down as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's often helpful to go back on another day and <strong>repeat the looking process</strong>&mdash;especially with a rough draft of your paper in hand. If reality intervenes and you just don't have time, then it's even more important to make sure that you take detailed notes and visually engage with the work in a serious way the first time you see it.

          Outlining a Formal Analysis Paper
        </h4>
        <p>
          A good way to test the coherence of a final draft&ndash;to see if indeed it qualifies as an essay rather than as a draft&mdash;is to outline it, paragraph by paragraph, in <em>two </em>ways, indicating
        </p>
        <ul class="grid pinkBox">
          <li class="flex" style="padding: 0;">
            <p>
              what each paragraph <strong>says</strong>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="flex" style="padding: 0;">
            <p>
              what each paragraph<strong> does</strong>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin: 2rem 0;">
          An outline of this sort, in which you force yourself to consider not only the content but also the function of each paragraph, will help you to see if your essay...
        </p>
        <ul class="boxList grid">
          <li>
            1) says something
          </li>
          <li>
            2) says it with the help of an effective structure.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="flex" style="margin: 3rem 0 1rem 0;">

        Make sure you proofread your papers for adhering to the information listed above, as well as incorrect grammar, spelling, punctuation, and other errors. In addition, make sure your paper includes a thesis statement. Your grade will reflect your ability to follow these guidelines. Refer to the rubric on the assignment page for grading guidelines.

          In the first paragraph – the introduction – you will include:
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>the name of the artist (if known), title (which is <em>italicized</em> <strong>every time you use the title in your paper</strong>), date, and medium (if known)</li>
          <li>what you think is the subject</li>
          <li>a very brief description of the work</li>
          <li>thesis statement (usually the last line or so of your first paragraph)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      
      <p>
        From that point, the rest of the formal analysis should include not only a description of the piece but especially those details of the work that have led you to come to your thesis. Yet, your paper should not be a random flow of ideas about the work (i.e., stream-of-consciousness writing). Rather, your paper should have a sense of order, moving purposefully through your description with regard to specific elements (e.g., one paragraph may deal with composition, another with a description of the figures, another with the background, another about line, etc.). Finally, in your conclusion (the final paragraph), you should end your paper with a restatement of your thesis.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important to remember that your interest here is strictly formal. <strong>No research is to be used in this paper.</strong> In other words, you are strictly relying on your ability to visually "read" a work of art and make interpretations about it based on your analysis of it. Remember that your analysis should not be just a mechanical, physical description. Please use descriptive language and adjectives to describe your work. Begin with a general description of the work, and then move on to the more specific elements.

        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Size:</strong> How big is the artwork? Are the figures or objects in the work life-size, larger or smaller than life? How does the size affect the work?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>

        One of the most basic art-historical concepts is line, and it manifests itself in many different ways depending on the work of art. In sculpture and architecture, we often speak of the <em>contour line</em>: the outline defining the perimeter of the shape. Contour lines also occur in two-dimensional words. Lines are powerful not only because they define shapes and order images, but because they also serve to direct your eyes, whether in architecture, sculpture, or painting. In most cases, the use of repeating lines at right angles conveys a sense of stability. Strong diagonals, on the other hand, often create tension and suggest motion. In two-dimensional arts, line is used primarily to describe or outline shapes. But the illusion of <em>volume</em> (or roundness) can also be indicated through the use of lines, as in <em>hatching</em> (short, sharp strokes that create shadows). Moreover, lines can be uniform and sharp or fuzzier and of inconsistent thickness.

    "Shape" : `
    <h4>
      Shape
    </h4>
    <p>
      For three-dimensional works such as sculpture and architecture, <em>shape </em>is defined by the <em>physical contours of the form</em>. In the case of two-dimensional works, shape is defined by lines or sometimes edges of colour. It exists on a flat plane (such as a canvas or photographic sheet) only in width and height. In abstract art, the quality of flatness is often emphasized: we are to understand shapes as surface elements. However, artists will often manipulate shapes in order to convey a sense of three dimensions. In painting, one of the most frequent ways to suggest this is by using tonal gradations or modeling, in which shadows and highlights stimulate the effects of light bouncing off uneven, projecting objects. Shapes, moreover, can be classified as <em>geometric</em>&nbsp;or <em>biomorphic</em>, which refers to natural forms, such as human figures, animals, and plants.
    </p>
    <ul class="grid boxList">
      <li>What shapes are used in your work?</li>
      <li>Has the artist suggested a three-dimensional shape if it is a two-dimensional work?</li>

    "Space" : `
    <h4>
      Space and Mass
    </h4>
    <p>
      The term <em>space</em> indicates whether an image conveys a sense of three-dimensional space. The term <em>mass</em> describes the space created by an artwork, indicating whether the artwork conveys a sense of substantial form&mdash;as if it had weight or volume. So far, we have talked about the definitions of solid shapes. We may refer to these as <em>positive </em>shapes. But there are also shapes created by the absence of solids. These can be called <em>negative shape</em>, or <em>space</em>: the void between or around solid shapes. In sculpture and architecture, these spaces are real. In two-dimensional art, space, like shape, is only implied. As with lines, space can have a powerful effect on a work of art and your experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Space can also be used in more metaphorical, expressive ways. In many two-dimensional works, one may often discern different layers of <em>pictorial depth</em>, a term referring to the recession of space into the distance. If we look at a landscape, for example, we can immediately sense which elements of the painting are closest to us and which are farther away. Yet, we are, of course, looking at a flat surface. The space that seems closest to us is referred to as the <em>foreground</em>, which seems farthest is referred to as the <em>background</em>, and between them is called the <em>middle ground</em>. Artists will manipulate these elements to control how you experience the image. One method of conveying depth is using a <em>scientific perspective</em>, when <em>orthogonal</em> lines intersect at a single point, referred to as a <em>vanishing point</em>. Another method is <em>intuitive perspective</em>, when diagonals lead in different directions and depth is based on the intuition or sensation of depth rather than a scientific system. There are many additional ways to show depth. For example, depth can be conveyed on a two-dimensional plane by placing the nearest figures lowest on the page and those farthest at the very top. Space is thus created by the stacking up of forms. This is referred to as <em>vertical perspective </em>and is commonly found in pre-Renaissance and non-Western art. Another way to indicate spatial distances is to use <em>overlapping<strong>, </strong></em>in which one form is placed in front of another. <em>Diminution</em>, in which the farther object is made smaller, is also a frequent means to convey depth. Finally, elements of line, light, and colour might also be used, as in the <em>atmospheric perspective. </em>This method is based on the observation that the closer an object is to the viewer, the sharper its outlines and the more intense its colour. Objects placed farther away lose their strong contours and hues, becoming faded and blurry.

    "Composition" : `
    <h4>
      Composition and Scale
    </h4>
    <p>The organization and arrangement of forms is referred to as <em>composition, </em>which greatly affects the meaning of a work of art, controlling visual focus and highlighting particular elements of the whole. To discern the composition of a work, it is important to be able to see underlying formal structures. In the case of abstract art, pick out the dominant forms and the way they are organized. In representational works, instead of seeing individual figures, try to see figures as a collection of cylinders, spheres, triangles, or whatever shapes they are composed of. How best to achieve this? The trick I learned in drawing class is particularly effective: turn the work upside down or sideways&mdash;your mind will be less ready to pick identifiable shapes and think "arm" and "leg," and will focus instead on the pure formal properties. Why is composition an important concept? Like the other formal elements we have considered, the way forms are arranged in a work often creates the overall message. As part of a formal analysis, you'll want to consider scale, or relative size, both within the work and in relation to the viewer. Determine if there's a consistent scale used within the work, or whether different scales are used to emphasize or de-emphasize certain elements in the image.</p>
    <ul class="grid boxList">
      <li>How do the various formal elements interact?</li>
      <li>Does the relationship convey the unity of the forms? How?</li>

    `,
    
    "Light" : `
    <h4>
      Light and Colour
    </h4>
    <p>Light affects both two- and three-dimensional works. Often, light is used to convey the volumes of slides. Artists of different eras used light in various ways. For example, Leonardo da Vinci used more heightened contrasts between light and dark&mdash;a technique referred to by the Italian term <em>chiaroscuro</em>, which translates literally as "light-dark." In some works, lights create more dramatic power than any other element.</p>
    <p><em>Colour, </em>also called <em>hue, </em>can also play an important role in a work of art. To understand the effects of colour in the work you are responding to, you need first to master some technical knowledge on the subject: there are three primary colours&mdash;red, yellow, and blue. By mixing them in various combinations, you arrive at the secondary colours: green, orange, and purple. Moreover, each of these colours can vary according to its <em>value </em>(degree of lightness or darkness) and <em>intensity </em>(degree of saturation). Often, the choice of colours, or <em>palette, </em>of a work of art sets a particular mood. Reds, yellows, and oranges are often referred to as warm or hot colours, whereas blues, greens, and purples are cool. While some artists use colour to convey the accurate hue of an object, artists from the Impressionists onwards begin to experiment and depart from the <em>local </em>(or authentic) <em>colours </em>of an object.</p>
    <ul class="grid boxList">
      <li>What role does light play in the work you have selected?</li>
      <li>Is it uniform and gentle? Or dramatic and theatrical?</li>
      <li>Where does it lead your eye?</li>
      <li>Is it disturbing or comforting? Why?</li>

    "Style" : `
    <h4>
      Style
    </h4>
    <p>Style is the final component for you to consider as you take notes on your chosen work of art. What do we mean by style? Don't confuse it with the popular definition&mdash;it has nothing to do with being fashionable. Style is a technical term with specific application in the field of art history, referring to the way in which the artist presents their subject to you. Style is a question of <em>how </em>the artist achieves their presentation. In painting and sculpture, there are <em>representational </em>and <em>non-representational </em>styles; the former depicts views or objects recognizable in the world, and the other is <em>abstract</em>&mdash;depicting forms and shapes that originate in the mind of the artist. Style also refers to how forms are presented. Are they defined primarily by line? In this case, you may call the work <em>linear</em>. <em>Painterly</em> style refers to the loose-stroke painting style that endows the forms with soft modeling rather than sharp outlines.</p>
    <p>There are four additional concepts for you to consider: <em>realism, naturalism, idealism, </em>and <em>abstraction.</em> Let's begin with the first. What is <em>realism</em>? <em>Realism </em>is the attempt to depict objects exactly as they are in actual visible reality, "warts and all." Like realism, <em>naturalism </em>is also based on the representation of the physical world; in this case, however, artists look to nature only for inspiration, rather than trying to achieve precise imitation. Naturalism might also have to do with the way a figure is rendered. For example, a naturalistic sculpture of a woman is <em>inspired </em>by the appearance of an actual young woman, but not a precise record of that woman. Drapery or clothing can also be termed as <em>naturalistic </em>if it hangs over the body in a believable way. Idealism and abstraction are more conceptual. In the case of <em>idealism, </em>the work of art is meant to communicate a kind of visual perfection or beauty. It is important to remember that beauty is not an absolute idea, but shifts from culture to culture&mdash;Victorian ideals of female beauty, for example, are quite different from those of modern Japan. In Greek sculpture, idealism was often conveyed through representations of the human figure, such as the <em>Doryphoros</em>. In Greek society, the youthful, athletic human figure, rendered in a naturalistic way, is considered the epitome of what was good and beautiful. Its sculptor, Polykleitos, devised a mathematical formula to produce the ideal male form, and the <em>Doryphoros </em>was intended as a representation of it. So, the <em>Doryphoros </em>is an example of both <em>naturalism </em>and <em>idealism</em>. <em>Abstraction </em>is another way to describe artistic style. In this case, the artist is less interested in the careful recording of how things look in nature and more interested in a certain visual property or pattern. In some works, however, there is no recognizable relation to subjects found in nature. Such works are referred to as <em>non-representational </em>or <em>non-objective</em> art. Twentieth-century art offers many examples of this style. Another artistic style is called <em>expressionism.</em> In this case, the work might be naturalistic, abstract, <em>or </em>idealistic&mdash;expressionism refers to any work that appeals to the emotions of the viewer, often in an exaggerated or theatrical way. Twentieth-century art provides us with many examples of expressionism, and these often also feature elements of abstraction. <em>Abstract Expressionism</em> is a specific period unto itself and refers to a school of painting and sculpture active in New York between 1940 and c. 1960.</p>
    <ul class="grid boxList">
      <li>In what style is your artist working?</li>
      <li>Do you see elements of abstraction? What are these elements?</li>
      <li>What do you think the artist meant to convey through their abstraction?</li>
      <li>Is it a naturalistic form? To what extent is it inspired by nature? To what extent does it depart from nature?</li>
      <li>Is it a realistic form? What makes it realistic? What seems "real" about it?</li>
      <li>Is it an ideal form? How do you know? What makes it characteristic of ideal beauty? And if so, to what culture does it belong?</li>
      <li>Is it expressionistic? Does it appeal primarily to your emotions? Which emotions and how?</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Tip: </strong>There is nothing wrong with using the words <em>realistic </em>and <em>idealized </em>in your essay, but keep in mind that it is not a matter of all-or-nothing; there are degrees of realism and degrees of idealization.</p>

    "Other" : `
    <h4>
      Other Elements
    </h4>
    <p>There are several other formal elements that might be important for you to consider. What, for instance, is the texture of the work? If it is uniformly smooth, does this smoothness contribute to a sense of harmony?</p>
    <p>Another formal element, one not quickly associated with art, is time. Time becomes a factor in sculpture when we find ourselves walking around or through it. Sculpture changes as the light changes, in the play of light and shadow across the surfaces of the work. Time entered the domain of art in radically new terms with the invention of photography in the nineteenth century. Photography seems to convey the essence of a particular time and place, and this aura of authenticity, together with its sense of instantaneous vision, of the moment itself, captured forever, constitutes a large part of its appeal. Today, it is apparent that the dialogue between the present moment of our seeing the photograph&mdash;our actual experience of it in "real" time&mdash;versus the way in which the photograph seems to embody, or make present, something long lost or far away, has revolutionized our sense of time and space. Two other art media&mdash;video and film&mdash;rely even more on time. One of the traditional distinctions among the arts has been that the plastic arts&mdash;painting, drawing, and sculpture&mdash;are <em>spatial </em>media, while the other arts&mdash;dance, music, and literature&mdash;are primarily <em>temporal </em>and <em>linear </em>in nature. Video and film are both.</p>

    "Sculpture" : `
    <h4>
      Sculpture
    </h4>
    <p>Sculpture can be either freestanding or relief, which means projecting from a surface like a wall or stone slab. There are several processes for making sculpture, including additive processes, in which the sculpture is built up, or modeled, from material like clay; subtractive processes, like carving stone or wood, in which material is taken away to create an image; and casting, in which molten metal is poured into a mold. In addition to these traditional processes, many artists, especially from the twentieth century onward, have created sculptures using a vast range of unconventional materials and techniques. The following basic questions will help you address three-dimensional forms:</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>What is the viewpoint suggested by the work? Does the sculpture visually lead the viewer to move around it and view it from different angles, or does it seem to guide the viewer to one position?</li>
      <li>What materials are used? How do they contribute to the work's form? Do the materials make open spaces within the sculpture possible, or do they require a more block-like form?</li>
      <li>Does the sculpture emphasize a sense of volume, of three-dimensional form, or of flatness?</li>
      <li>Does the sculpture use the play of light over the surface to create a pattern of lights and shadows? Does this emphasize the three-dimensional form or flatness? Does it create a sense of drama or movement?</li>
      <li>If the surface of the sculpture is coloured, how does that affect the viewer's perception of the work? Does colour serve to emphasize certain features of the work? Does it make the work seem more or less three-dimensional?</li>
      <li>What is the texture of the surface? Is it smooth or rough, dull or shiny?</li>

    "Architecture" : `

      Architecture

    <p>Architecture demands that the viewer take into account both the physical and visual experience of the building and the spaces it creates. In discussing architecture, you may want to talk about the plan (or layout) of a building; an elevation (the side of a building); or the section (an imaginary vertical slice through the building). The following questions will be useful:</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>What is the scale of the building in relation to humans?</li>
      <li>What parts of the building seem to be emphasized? Is the system of design readily apparent? Does the building appear to be composed of geometric or more organic (soft and curving) forms?</li>
      <li>Does the building seem accessible to the viewer from the outside? How large and visible are doors and windows?</li>
      <li>Does the building convey a sense of solidity or of the interplay of solids and negative spaces? Do the forms of the building use light and shadow to break up the sense of solidity? Is there a play of light and dark across the surface?</li>
      <li>How are ornaments used on the building? Do the ornaments enhance the viewer's awareness of three-dimensional form or do they emphasize the building's surface?</li>
      <li>How does the building fit its environment? Does it seem to be distinct from or part of its surroundings? How does it change the viewer's perception of those surroundings?</li>
      <li>Is the interior divided into rooms or is it one open space? How does the arrangement of interior spaces either help move the viewer through the building, or hinder the viewer's movement through the building? Which spaces are readily accessible and which are remote or blocked off?</li>

    <h4>
      Installation Art
    </h4>
    <p>Installation art is artwork made for a specific site that creates a total environment rather than being placed in a pre-existing environment. The kinds of formal questions you might ask about an installation focus on the visual and spatial elements of the work and the viewer's experience of it. The issues are similar to those confronted in sculpture and architecture.</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>What sense of space is created by the installation? How does the artist work with the environment or surroundings? Is it an installation you can enter and interact with, or does the viewer stay outside the space?</li>
      <li>What effect does the environment created by the installation have on you? Does it come across as overwhelming&mdash;does it dwarf the viewer&mdash;or make the viewer feel large? How does the scale of the elements work?</li>
      <li>How do light, colour and texture affect this sense of space and your experience of the environment?</li>
      <li>Does the installation change over time (perhaps through the participation of viewers, or through the decay of materials it incorporates)?</li>
    </ul>

    "Performance" : `
    <h4>
      Performance
    </h4>
    <p>In performance art, the artist&mdash;or, more precisely, the artist's movements, gestures, and sounds, either alone or in dialogue with an audience&mdash;becomes the artwork. Although performance art is an integral part of the contemporary art scene, artists in the early twentieth century also engaged in it, notably Tristan Tzara and other artists whose anarchic works are collectively known as Dada. While live performance pieces are unique events, many artists today use video to document and display performance works, such as South African artist Berni Searle's (b. 1964) Snow White (2001). Questions about performance could include:</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>Does the performance piece seem improvisational, or planned and rehearsed?</li>
      <li>How does the artist interact with the audience? Does the audience remain relatively uninvolved, or does the audience participate in the performance? Is the audience's reaction or participation guided by the artist, or is it an uncontrolled aspect of the performance?</li>
      <li>Is the space important to the performance? Has the artist altered the performance space in any way?</li>
      <li>How are words, music, and gestures used?</li>
      <li>What is the presentation of the artist's body? What clothing and/or accessories do they wear?</li>
    </ul>

    "Digital" : `
    <h4>
      Digital Art
    </h4>
    <p>The term "digital art" applies to works of art made with digital computer technology. This may include websites, CDROM, and virtual reality as well as the incorporation of digital processes into established media, such as photo retouching, graphic design, video editing, and architectural rendering, in which the final outcome may take a more traditional form. Digital artworks are often works that it would not have been possible to create using more traditional media. In addition to questions you might ask based on those for other art forms, questions specific to digital art include:</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>What role does digital technology play in the creation of this work?</li>
      <li>What effects does it make possible that would not have been possible otherwise?</li>
      <li>Do these effects heighten the sense of reality or fantasy in the work? That is, do they make the image seem more or less "real"?</li>
      <li>How does digital technology invite the viewer to participate in the piece?</li>

    "Textile" : `
    <h4>
      Textile and Decorative Arts
    </h4>
    <p>Textiles, ceramics, and utilitarian or decorative objects of all kinds can be analyzed in formal terms, just like painting, architecture, and sculpture:</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>Is the function of the object immediately evident? How is the object designed to be functional? Are there aspects of the design that could hinder its functionality?</li>
      <li>How are materials used? Is there an emphasis on the richness or variety of materials?</li>
      <li>Is there an emphasis on the texture? How would this object feel to the touch?</li>
      <li>Is there an emphasis on simplicity or complexity of form and design? Are there figural and/or geometric elements on the surface? Do the decorative elements, if any, make reference to the function of the piece?</li>
      <li>What is the role of colour or line in shaping the viewer's perception of the work?</li>
      <li>For textiles specifically, what techniques have been used to create the cloth (for example, felting, weaving, plaiting, quilting, or applique)? Is it a close weave or an open weave? Is the design simple or intricate? What yarns are used (for example, cotton, linen, sheep's wool, llama wool)? Does the textile incorporate other materials, such as glass or wood, beads or sequins?</li>
