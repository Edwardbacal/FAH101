        The Art of Making a Tapestry

      <p>
        Tapestry is one of the oldest forms of woven textile. As a technique, tapestry has been used to create everything from tunics and purses to table covers and chair backs, as well as some of the world's largest and most beautiful pieces of textile art.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Europe, the great period of tapestry weaving ran from the second half of the 14th century to the end of the 18th century. This period is best known for the production of wall-hangings woven in this technique, which we generally refer to as tapestries. Tapestries were owned by the elite and used to decorate both private and public spaces. Henry VIII is recorded as having 2,000 tapestries hanging in his various palaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        Large tapestries added vibrant colour to a room. They kept out draughts and provided both entertainment and food for thought through their dramatic depiction of stories from the Bible, mythology and the classics, or their revealing portrayal of fashionable life. They were extremely costly to produce and so served to demonstrate their owner's wealth. Unlike today, tapestries were not simply static objects, but were often rolled up and moved between residences. In the 1540s, King Francis I of France even commissioned a set of tapestries which reproduced the wall decoration of his newly renovated Great Gallery at Fontainebleau Palace in woven form. This set could be rolled up and transported to his other residences.

      Hannah Ryggen fought against war, abuse of power and social injustice. Textile art was her foremost weapon in this fight. Several of Ryggen's works were direct reactions to political events that occurred in her lifetime, as we will examine later on this page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ryggen was born on 21 March 1894 and grew up in a working class community in Malm&ouml;, Sweden, and trained as a teacher. She taught during the day, and took evening classes in drawing and painting with the artist Fredrik Krebs at the technical college in Lund.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a study trip to Dresden, she met her future husband, the artist Hans Ryggen. The young couple moved to Norway, to &Oslash;rlandet in Tr&oslash;ndelag County.

    <p>
      Ryggen was self-taught in weaving technique and choice of materials. She often took control of the entire artistic process: carding, spinning and dying the yarn herself. With wool coloured with plant dyes, and with current political themes, she helped elevate tapestries from a handicraft to fine art.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pot blue, also known as "pee blue", became the main colour of her tapestries and stood for the positive aspects of life, longing and dreams. Her love for this colour is reflected in, among other things, the self-portrait <em>Pot Blue</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      She used urine to create the beautiful blue colour in the yarn, so the "pee bucket" always stood ready for her guests.

    <h4>
      Activist Works
    </h4>
    <p>
      The struggle against war, fascism and social injustice characterised Ryggen's works in the 1930s. When the war came to Norway in 1940, Ryggen was personally impacted when her husband was arrested and sent to Grini prison camp. During the war years, Ryggen wove several tapestries in which she protested against the abuse of power by the Germans and honoured Norwegians who died for freedom. Ryggen was a rebel and a peace activist her entire life. Even after her death (2 February 1970 in Trondheim), her works continue to inspire us to stand together and fight injustice, abuse of power and human humiliation.

      Take some time to closely look at and analyze Hannah Ryggen's <em>Ethiopia</em> tapestry. What details do you notice first and why? How did Ryggen use the elements of art and principles of design within the tapestry? After spending some time analyzing <em>Ethiopia</em>, read the following excerpt from Marit Paasche, <a href="https://librarysearch.library.utoronto.ca/permalink/01UTORONTO_INST/14bjeso/alma991106626330006196" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Hannah Ryggen: Threads of Defiance</em></a> (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2019).

      <h4>
        Denunciations
      </h4>
      <p>
        The composition of <em>Ethiopia</em> (<em>Etiopia</em>) (1935) is dominated by two horizontal bands. The lower one is entirely occupied by an abstract pattern, while the upper contains figures, hands, spears and inscriptions. This tapestry is large, and the interplay between vertical and horizontal lines creates a distinctive rhythm. The lower band is made of three pieces sewn together, but apart from subtle differences in the grey-brown background hue, the colour scheme is consistently maintained in all three. As a contrast, Ryggen has woven in geometric forms in untreated dark brown and natural white wool.
      </p>
      <p>
        The figures in the upper register relate to Italy's invasion of Ethiopia. Here Ryggen has also introduced a red tone: in the African woman on the far-left side, for the bracelets on the wrists of the dark-skinned hands and in the figure of Emperor Haile Selassie.<sup>1</sup> This upper band is in effect a framework for the figures. Ryggen had set up the warp threads originally intending to weave a pillow cover, "but then I saw that it was so beautiful on the surface, and when I subsequently had done the first negro, the rest just fell into place."<sup>2</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        The area between the African woman and the white male figure to her right is taken up with an abstract pattern, elements of which resemble spear tips. The white man is wearing a hat, and his sun cross, the symbol of the Nasjonal Samling, the Norwegian far-right party, and also of other Nazi-sympathizing parties is clearly visible.<sup>3</sup> He is probably the French politician Pierre Laval, who was the spokesperson for France in negotiations with Italy. Albert Steen suggests he might also be the Italian ambassador to Ethiopia, who had sworn his allegiance to Selassie just before the Italians began bombing Ethiopian cities.<sup>4</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Below the simple yet intricate ornamentation that contains the words "Haile Selassie" is a row of nine hands&mdash;four black, one white and four yellowish-brown. Ethiopia's emperor is imposing in all his magnificence, and Ryggen's depictions of Selassie bears a certain resemblance to an image of him printed in the weekly <em>Ukebladet Hjemmet</em> in 1935.<sup>5</sup> Further to the right, an African man holds Mussolini's head aloft on a spear, under which is inscribed "hr M": Hannah Ryggen could hardly have made her sentiments regarding the dictator any clearer.<sup>6</sup>
