    NOT a cubist, however, his artistic rivalry with Picasso motivated each of them to push their experiments in painting, leading Picasso toward what would become Cubism.

        "Around 1897 he became acquainted with the paintings of the impressionists and from this point colour became the most important element in his pictures. The energy and radical nature of his experiments with colour in such pictures as Portrait of Madame Matisse (1905) and Open Window Collioure (1905) ensured his leadership of the fauves. His aims, however, were different from those of the impressionists and of the short-lived fauve movement: in 1908 he wrote in his Notes d'un peintre, 'I dream of an art of balance, purity and calm, without troubling or depressing themes, that will offer … a soothing influence.' This aim is illustrated in the large figure compositions, increasingly simple in form, of the period 1905–10, including Luxe, calme et volupté (1905), Joie de vivre (1906), and La Danse (1909). During this period Matisse began to spend the summers painting in the south of France. He travelled widely between 1907 and 1914 and developed an admiration for Near East art, which inspired the exotic decorations that feature in many of his paintings."

      Picasso's <em>Les Demoiselles d'Avignon</em> has acquired a mythical status: it is a manifesto, a battlefield, a herald of modern art. Fully conscious that he was producing a major work, Picasso threw everything into its elaboration: all his ideas, all his energy, all his knowledge.

      Bordello pictures are part of a long tradition within the genre of erotic art (a tradition that Picasso knew well...). These soft-porn scenes are meant to gratify the voyeurism of male, heterosexual, art lovers. Picasso overthrows this tradition: interrupting the story, the gaze of his demoiselles challenges the (male) spectator by signifying to him that his comfortable position, outside the narrative scene, is not as secure as he might think.

    <p>
      The approbation of and enthusiasm for primitive art, generally understood to mean the art of Africa and the Pacific Islands. Western artists had a particular interest in this type of ethnic art c.1905–c.1935, beginning with the Fauves, Cubists, and Die Brücke who incorporated elements of it into their own work. This in turn led to a deeper study of this subject by both anthropologists and art historians.

      It was during the first decades of the 20th century that modernist painting, sculpture and printmaking were most responsive to the arts of Africa and the Pacific. Maurice de Vlaminck's acquisition of some African sculptures c.1905 was followed by Picasso's visit to the Musée d'Ethnographie du Trocadéro in Paris in 1907 and his subsequent assimilation of African and Pacific forms in the painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907; New York, MOMA). Members of Die Brücke, such as Emil Nolde, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Max Pechstein and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, drew inspiration from art seen in ethnographic museums or, in Nolde's and Pechstein's case, on journeys to the Pacific Islands, and translated their responses into paintings, woodcuts and wood-carvings of rare starkness and vehemence. Surrealist artists were attracted to a variety of American, African and Pacific objects: Max Ernst drew inspiration from Easter Island petroglyphs, Joan Miró from masks of Arctic peoples, and Alberto Giacometti from various Polynesian sources. In the history of modernist sculpture, the achievements of Constantin Brancusi, Amedeo Modigliani, Jacob Epstein and Henry Moore, among others, may confidently be linked to non-Western antecedents, predominantly African.
    </p>
    <p>
      While modernist ideals in the early 20th century were shaped, on the one hand, by principles of simplification, reduction to essence and organic gracefulness and, on the other, by a more agitated desire to accelerate artistic progress through an espousal of the outlandish and extravagant, it may be said that its standards of formal evolution were set by the arts of peoples labeled “primitive” or “barbaric.” Artists as diverse as Matisse and Schmidt-Rottluff found this example highly persuasive, and few avant-garde artists worked without at least one talismanic sample of what was taken to be the African or Pacific vision in the studio. Only the Futurists, for reasons of ideology, resisted the allure of African and Pacific culture.

      What's the <em>effect</em> of this painting?
    </h4>
    <p>
      The painting is unsettling - in its subject matter and its appearance, in its origins and its achievement. There is no doubt that the work marked a turning-point in Picasso's development, and that it provoked an extreme reaction in Braque, bringing the two artists into creative dialogue. On the other hand, almost nothing of the subject, scale, colour, form or mood of this painting - nothing of its ambition - survives into Picasso's Cubism proper. Les Demoiselles d'Avignon is not so much the first Cubist painting, then, as the traumatic rupture that enables Cubism to begin.

    <h4>
      Beaux Arts
    </h4>
    
    <p>
      A term applied to the style of classically inspired architecture, deriving from the teaching of the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, which laid emphasis on the architecture of antiquity and that of the Renaissance and 17th- and 18th-century France. It was particularly prevalent in the United States and France in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and was characterized by formal planning overlaid with rich detail that was often overemphasized or overscaled. Victor Laloux's Hôtel de Ville in Paris (1897–1904) and Warren & Wetmore's Grand Central Station in New York (1903–13) are good examples. The style can be found in Manhattan skyscrapers and town houses, Parisian blocks of flats, and British department stores. After 1918 the traditional Beaux-Arts style became obsolete and was superseded by the emerging modern movement.

    `,
    "impressionism" : `
    <h4>
      Impressionism
    </h4>
    <p>
      A movement in French painting, associated particularly with Monet, Pissarro, Sisley, Degas, and Renoir, characterized by the use of a bright palette, broken brushwork, and an emphasis on depictions of contemporary life and landscape. The term was originally coined as a form of satire by the critic Louis Leroy reviewing the first exhibition of the Société Anonyme des artistes, peintres, sculpteurs, graveurs…which opened on 15 April 1874, at the Parisian studio of the photographer Nadar on the boulevard des Capucines, and is nowadays referred to as the first Impressionist exhibition. Monet's painting Impression: Sunrise 1873 (Musée Marmottan, Paris) was singled out for particular attack, Leroy maintaining that the term 'impression' was too personal and should not have been used in a picture title (effet, i.e. an effect of nature, would have been preferable). In fact, 'impression' had a complex duality in 19th-century artistic theory, implying on the one hand the reception by the artist of the scene presented to him, on the other the subjective trace of the artist's own nature or temperament in the resulting work of art. The term 'Impressionist' rapidly went into widespread usage as a result of the 1874 exhibition and a further seven shows were staged, the last in 1886. There were a number of important contributory factors to the evolution of Impressionism: a growing interest in colour theory and the laws of complementary contrasts; an increasing liking, among landscape painters, for working en plein air; and a growing dissatisfaction with the official Salon exhibitions where many of the young Impressionists experienced frequent rejection. By the time of the final 1886 Impressionist exhibition, many of the participants had begun to experience considerable success, lauded by avant-garde critics and increasingly patronized by enlightened collectors. It was in the 1890s, however, that Impressionism really began to find its international market, especially in America (Britain by contrast was curiously slow to appreciate its merits). Paradoxically, it was also around this time that Impressionism began to be perceived, in certain right-wing religious circles in France, as the art of materialism, concerned only with the everyday. As a style it had become widespread, attracting a plethora of minor and repetitive adherents. Nevertheless, in the course of the 20th century Impressionism can fairly claim to have become the most widely popular of all movements with art lovers and collectors.
    </p>
    `,
    "post-impressionism" : `
    <h4>
      Post-Impressionism
    </h4>
    
    <p>
      As the name implies, a term used to describe developments after and arising from Impressionism. It was first coined by the English painter and critic Roger Fry (1866–1934), who organized the exhibition Manet and the Post-Impressionists held at the Grafton Galleries, London in 1910–11. The imprecision of such an umbrella term, for all its undoubted usefulness, is demonstrated by the wide variety of developments from Impressionism: the quasi-scientific examination of colour by Seurat and the Neo-Impressionists; the structured examination of landscape by Cézanne in which lay the seeds of Cubism; the writhing, expressive brushwork of Van Gogh; the flat colour Symbolism of Gauguin and his followers.
    </p>
    `,
    "fauvism" : `
    <h4>
      Fauvism
    </h4>
    
    <p>
      Derived from the French word fauve, 'wild beast', with which the critic Louis Vauxcelles described Matisse, Vlaminck, Derain, Rouault, and Marquet when he saw the flat patterns and strong colours of their works exhibited in 1905 in the Salon d'Automne in Paris, Fauvism briefly brought together these painters who were seeking, in the wake of Gauguin, Van Gogh, and Cézanne, to explore the expressive potential of colour. In its emphasis on the material, sensuous element of painting, it has been related to the emergence in literature of the poetic movement known as 'le naturisme', which in the closing years of the 19th c. played a major role in the reaction against Symbolism.

        "You see, the whole Renaissance tradition is antipathetic to me. The hard-and-fast rules of perspective which it succeeded in imposing on art were a ghastly mistake which it has taken four centuries to redress: Cézanne and, after him, Picasso and myself can take a lot of credit for
        this. Sceintific perspective is nothing but fooling illusionism; it is simply a trick - a bad trick - which makes it impossible for an artist to convey a full experience of space, since it forces the objects in a picture to disappear away from the beholder instead of bringing them within his reach, as painting should."

            Pushing the tree over to the left of the house, Braque made the relationships between the walls and the roof more conspicuous. He applied an inconsistent chiaroscuro (modelling with light and dark tones), in which the light seems to fall now from the right, now from the left. At the same time, the shapes formed on the picture surface by the overlapping of objects in the represented space are made to relate to each other: the foliage at bottom right, for example, forms itself into a strange ridge that tries to link up with the eaves of the house above it. Finally, Braque inserts an area of house colour into the cleft in the tree to top left where, as is evident in the photograph, there should be foliage. Whereas Cezanne sought to capture depth and surface at the same time by representing the world in a logic of colours, Braque, reducing his palette to a crude code, has perhaps let the superficially odd effects of Cezanne's system overtake the logic. It could also be said that Braque has begun to abandon coherence of illusion - but what replaces it? The answer cannot be simply 'incoherence', since everything in the painting is obviously tightly controlled and balanced. The detached piece of'house' colour, or the contagious ridges, or the rhyming triangles, are like elements of the world set free to circulate in the painter's imagination.

        <h5>First off, what <em>is</em> Analytic Cubism</h5>
        <p>
          "Analytic Cubism (roughly 1908 to 1912) has come to refer to a process where three-dimensional objects are broken down into fragments - corresponding to their appearance from different viewpoints in space - which are then recombined in two-dimensions to produce a representation. Analytical Cubism supposedly proceeds from observed reality to art, and the near monochrome works by Braque and Picasso... especially from around 1910-11, are usually treated as classic examples of the method. Although Analytic Cubist painting rejects single-point perspective, its combination of multiple viewpoints is thought to offer a fuller version of perceived reality."

              The picture is thus fairly easy to decode: it represents an allegorical scene of pastoral fertility, an autumn harvest in which harmony exists between humanity and nature, and where an equation is drawn between cycles of natural production and the fertility of idealized womanhood. It is easy to find precedents for Abundance in the most tedious of academic paintings, and in Rococo-style decorative cycles based on the theme of the four seasons. Furthermore, the idea of a naive or Arcadian fertility was pervasive, not only in the official but in the avant-garde Salons around 1900. A woman in a landscape as an image of fertility carried a number of meanings. She was fundamentally natural rather than cultural, creative physically rather than mentally, and the close identification of her with nature meant that the tilled earth of France itself was to be equated with womanhood.
            </p>
            <p>
              ... Approaching Abundance with the benefit of a detailed exploration of Braque and Picasso's achievements of the previous years, it is clear that many of the representational devices that they had subjected to such scrutiny remained unquestioned by Le Fauconnier. Notwithstanding his pronouncements on mathematics, the painter has left the integrity of objects undisturbed, and the ample roundness of flesh and apples is reassuringly integrated and fixed in its proper place, bounded by descriptive lines and given careful local colouring. There is no difficulty in seeing the woman, boy and landscape, since the method adopted amounts to nothing more than a mannerism, and the results are hardly elegant. The area around the woman's hips and buttocks shows just how much trouble Le Fauconnier had in drawing this way.

        Theories of Cubism

        <p>
          The "conceptual" theory of Cubism, as a superior way of looking at the external world.
        </p>
        <p>
          For writers like Guillaume Apollinaire, Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger (also cubist painters themselves), Andre Salmon, and Maurice Raynal, Cubism posits "the superiority of conceptual knowledge over merely perceptual realism." "Stating that natural vision is impoverished since we can never see the whole of a three-dimensional object from any single vantage point... they argued that Cubism overcomes this handicap by breaking with a single perspective to show the sides and back simultaneously with the front, so that we apprehend the thing from everywhere, grasping it conceptually as a composite of the views we would have if we actually moved around it."

          The formalist view of Cubism, as an engagement with the internal space of the picture.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, "Cubism was exclusively concerned with bringing about the unity of the pictorial object... the necessary fusion of two seemingly irreconcilable opposites: the depicted volumes of "real" objects and the flatness of the painter's own physical object (just as "real" as anything in the world before the artist), which is the canvas plane of the picture."
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, the American critic Clement "Greenberg saw Analytical Cubism as the increasing fusion of two types of flatness: the "depicted flatness" by which the tilted planes shoved the fragmented objects closer and closer to the surface; and the "literal flatness" of that surface itself."

          André Salmon
        </h4>
        
        <p>
          Poet, novelist, and art critic. A very Parisian figure, Salmon is best remembered as an impresario and chronicler of the arts who did much to promote the 'vie d'artiste' in Montparnasse and the merits of artists such as Picasso and Modigliani who were among his familiars (see his Souvenirs sans fin, 3 vols., 1955–61). An eclectic and enthusiastic critic, he launched the review Le Festin d'Ésope with Apollinaire and Jacob in 1903. His intensely lyrical poetry, always tinged with nostalgia but often humorous and linguistically playful, is at its best in Créances (1926), Carreaux (1928), and Les Étoiles dans l'encrier (1952). Of his novels, the best is probably Le Manuscrit trouvé dans un chapeau (1919).

          Guillaume Apollinaire
        </h4>
        <p>
          French poet and art critic. Apollinaire was 'the most influential art critic writing in France during the decade before the outbreak of war in 1914…a cardinal figure in creating the artistic climate of Paris early in this century—a climate in which anything and everything was thought possible' (John Golding, Visions of the Modern, 1994). He earned his living mainly with journalism and was one of the prototypes of the modern critic, his writing containing much that is superficial and gossipy. His importance stems not so much from the quality of his writing as from his brilliance as a propagandist on behalf of those artists he most admired. In particular he championed Picasso (his first substantial articles, in 1905, were on him) and later the Cubists in general (including the Orphists, whose name he coined). Among the other artists whose reputations he either established or consolidated were Chagall, de Chirico, Derain, Matisse, and Henri Rousseau. He was also influential on Dada (his friend Marcel Duchamp's interest in visual punning was partly inspired by Apollinaire's love of jest and linguistic acrobatics) and on Surrealism (he coined the term in 1917 and his suggestion that artists should explore 'interior universes' stimulated André Breton, who dedicated the first Surrealist manifesto to his memory). Apollinaire was wounded in the head serving in the French army in 1916; weakened by this, he died of influenza two years later.

          Ambroise Vollard
        </h4>
        
        <p>
          French dealer, connoisseur, publisher, and writer, one of the most important champions of avant-garde art in the early 20th century. In 1893 he opened a gallery in Paris and in 1895 he gave the first important exhibition of Cézanne’s work. Other landmark events included the first one-man exhibitions of Picasso (1901) and Matisse (1904). His clientele included some of the leading collectors of the day, among them Albert C. Barnes and Gertrude and Leo Stein. As well as buying and selling paintings, Vollard played an important role as a publisher by encouraging his artists to work as printmakers. He commissioned them to illustrate books (literary classics as well as contemporary works) and also issued independent portfolios of prints, notably Picasso’s Vollard Suite, consisting of 100 etchings on various themes made between 1930 and 1937. His portrait was painted many times, among others by Bonnard, Cézanne, Picasso, Renoir, and Rouault. Vollard’s writings included books on Cézanne and Degas and the autobiographical Recollections of a Picture Dealer (1936); a slightly expanded French version, Souvenirs d’un marchand de tableaux, appeared in 1937.

          Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler
        </h4>
        
        <p>
          German-born art dealer, publisher, and writer, who became a French citizen in 1937. In 1907 he opened a gallery in Paris. His first purchases were of Fauvist works, but he is best known as the friend and promoter of the Cubists. In 1912 Braque and Picasso signed contracts giving Kahnweiler exclusive rights to buy their entire outputs. He was also a friend and supporter of Juan Gris, of whom he wrote a standard biography (1947). As a publisher he brought out numerous books illustrated by his artist friends. In 1961 he published an autobiography, Mes galeries et mes peintres; in the introduction to the English translation, My Galleries and Painters (1971), John Russell wrote: ‘Where the old-style dealers did their artists a favour by inviting them to luncheon, Kahnweiler lived with Picasso, Braque, Gris, Derain, and Vlaminck on a day-to-day, hour-to-hour basis. The important thing was not so much that they should sell as that they should be free to get on with their work; and Kahnweiler, by making this possible, helped to bring into being what now seems to us that last great flowering of French art.’

          Structuralism  
        </h3>
        <p>
          Twentieth‐century school of critical thought. <strong>Ferdinand de Saussure</strong> argued that underlying the everyday use of language is a language system (langue), based on relationships of difference. He stressed the arbitrary nature of the relationship between the signifier (sound or image) and the signified (concept). Initially a linguistic theory, Claude Lévi‐Strauss and Roland Barthes developed structuralism into a mode of critical analysis of cultural institutions and products. It is associated especially with the notion of a literary text as a system of signs.

          For Braque, letters were "forms which could not be distorted because, being quite flat, they existed outside space and their presence in the painting, through contrast, enabled one to distinguish between objects situated in space and objects outside it".

    <h4>
      The Grebo
    </h4>
    <p>
      The Grebo or Glebo people are an ethnic group or subgroup within the larger Kru group of Africa, a language and cultural ethnicity, and to certain of its constituent elements. They are principally located along the southern border region of Liberia and C'ôte d'Ivoire
    </p>
    <p>
      The Grebo are known for their carved wooden masks, which were worn in ceremonies to mediate or propitiate the spirits. White clay is applied to participants in certain ceremonies, to denote a ku or spirit. Dancers wearing the carved masks are also daubed with it.

      <h5>Some context on why these masks were in France</h5>
      <h5>
        In the Ivory Coast:
      </h5>
      <p>
        "By the end of the 1880s, France had established control over the coastal regions... and in 1889 Britain recognized French sovereignty in the area. That same year, France named Treich-Laplène the titular governor of the territory. In 1893, Ivory Coast became a French colony..."
      </p>
      <p>
        "France's main goal was to stimulate the production of exports. Coffee, cocoa, and palm oil crops were soon planted along the coast. Ivory Coast stood out as the only West African country with a sizeable population of European settlers; elsewhere in West and Central Africa, Europeans who emigrated to the colonies were largely bureaucrats. As a result, French citizens owned one-third of the cocoa, coffee, and banana plantations and adopted the local forced-labour system."
      </p>
      <cite>
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_Coast
      </cite>
      <h5>
        In Liberia
      </h5>
      <p>
        Not under French rule but American influence which, with "other international interests emphasized resource extraction, with rubber production a major industry in the early 20th century. In 1914, Imperial Germany accounted for three quarters of the trade of Liberia."
      </p>
      <cite>
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberia
      </cite>
    </div>
    <p>
      In other words, there is an established political and commercial system of exporting goods from these countries to Europe. Masks aren't exactly typical commodities of colonial trade / extraction, but this exchange still exists within this system.
    </p>
    <p>
      French artists would likely acquire these from merchants bringing goods in to seaside port towns.
    </p>
    <p>
      These masks would also be worn in ritual/ceremonial contexts that give them their spiritual and cultural value. Hung on a wall in a glass case, these masks are isolated from their context (imagine if aliens came to earth, brought back halloween masks to put in their museums, but didn't know about trick-or-treating).

            In this work two pieces of newspaper float within a charcoal drawing. The lower piece overlaps with the body of a violin, and has a small 'f' hole drawn on it as counterpart to a larger one to the right. The differential scale of the two holes is a clear semiotic suggestion that the front plane of the violin is not parallel to the picture plane, but instead turns into the 'depth' of the picture. The other newspaper fragment to the right of the violin is apparently in the background 'space'. [Rosalind] Krauss has pointed out that these two pieces are in fact cut from the same sheet of paper in a single act (two silhouettes are thus 'drawn' at once), but that one has been turned over to reveal its back. This act of flipping over the paper is a symbol for 'depth' rather than, as in the (minimal) case of the 'f' holes, a picture of it. Furthermore, the newspaper changes role according to its position: in the 'background' it is the void of shadow, in the body of the violin it is the solidity of wood. This to-and-fro of void and solid, of front and back, of depth and surface, is Picasso's way of including what is absent from Cubism, even if only by pointing at the other missing half of a presence (eg 'depth' where there is only surface). And his new way of pointing is symbolic, or thoroughly semiotic, rather than iconic, or by resemblance. The ability to conjure up semiotically what is outside the limits of representational picturing was now inaugurated by newspaper cuttings: the most abstract of pictorial things (depth, shadow, light, colour) could be 'said' if not shown through the most concrete of pictorial elements (outlines, planes and colours).

        Yve-Alain Bois summarizes the Cubism's influence on abstraction:
      </h5>
      <p>
        Cubism was the first style to perform this paradox of an art that appears both abstract and realist, and it remained the crucible for most abstract artists. Yet "Cubism did not accept the logical consequences of its own discoveries," Mondrian remarked in a retrospect shared by others, "it was not developing towards its own goals, the expression of pure plastics." Thus in 1912-13 some artists pushed the "analytical" aspect of Cubism to dissolve the motif altogether. They did so either in linear coordination with the implicit grid of the canvas, as with Mondrian... or through prismatic effects of color seen as light, as with Delaunay... If Mondrian explicated the grid in a way that exceeded the faceted planes of Cubism, Delaunay intensified color in a manner that was alien to its muted palette. Meanwhile, other artists pushed the "synthetic" aspect of Cubism: the flat shapes of Cubist collage were the immediate precedent for the abstract color  planes of Malevich, while the factual elements of Cubist construction, which Picasso showed Vladimir Tatlin in Paris in the spring of 1914, were one provocation of his Constructivist "analysis of materials." Some kind of passage through Cubism became almost a  prerequisite for followers: "From a [Cubist] analysis of the volume and space of objects to the [Constructivist] organization of elements," the Russian Liubov Popova (1889-1924) wrote in a 1922 studio note, as if this development were already a catechism.
      </p>
      <p>moreover...</p>
      
      <p>
        Even as abstraction moved away from a mimetic relation to the world it did not necessarily embrace the "arbitrary" nature of the sign as explored in Cubist collage and construction. Abstract artists might have declined to depict worldly things, but they often aspired to evoke transcendental concepts-such as "spirit," or "purity"-and in this way they replaced one type of grounding, one form of authority, with another.

        A name* appropriated from Symbolist theorists by Guillaume Apollinaire, and used to designate the work of Robert Delaunay, Marcel Duchamp, Fernand Léger, Francis Picabia and (to an extent) Pablo Picasso that revealed a tendency towards colour abstraction. Though hardly any of the artists accepted the label, Apollinaire argued that they shared a common interest in 'pure' painting, which would give a 'pure aesthetic pleasure'

      So what were Picasso and Braque up to?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The rise of abstract painting dovetailed with a return to <em>figuration</em>, whether by dialing down Cubism's visual ambiguity, instead emphasizing recognizable figures and themes, to a return to Classical style.

    <h5>
      Some context
    </h5>
    <p>
      The lead-up to World War I saw a dramatic rise in nationalism among Europe's big powers that coincided with a reactionary turn toward the "traditional" - nostalgic fantasies about of pre-lapsarian Classicism, often tinged with an air of racial purity 🤮
    </p>
    <p>  
      Cubism was already vilified in the popular press as being un-French, even too German. Meanwhile, the (actually) German gallerists and dealers who were instrumental in supporting Cubism's advancement (Daniel Henry-Kahnwiler, Ambroise Vollard, and Wilhelm Uhde) were deported and disenfranchised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things didn't get better after the war: the death of many leading art figures, economic ruin, and the generalized trauma of war did little to nurture artistic experimentation among established artists. 
    </p>
    
    <div class="igBox"  style="margin: 20vh 0;">
      <h4>
        A return to order?
      </h4>
      <p>
        The <em>rappel à l'ordre</em> (return to order) issued a call for a return to the presumed classical roots of French art, in the course of which its proponents opened an attack on Cubism. The beginnings of this return are assigned various dates, a late one being the 1923 essay by Jean Cocteau "Le Rappel a I'Ordre," a much earlier one being Apres le Cubisme, published in 1918 by the painter Amedee Ozenfant and the architect Charles-Edouard Jeanneret (later known as Le Corbusier). But what all these calls to order have in common is the idea that the prewar period was defined by chaos, by a decadent sensuality that needed to be replaced by the purity of classical rationalism, and by the barbarization of French culture by German influences. In fact, Ozenfant and Jeanneret called on artists to focus on the golden section and other ideas of classical proportion, making it possible for there to be a "new Pythagoras." "Science and great Art have the common ideal of generalizing," they wrote. Arguing that if "The Greeks triumphed over the Barbarians" it was because they sought intellectual beauty beneath sensory beauty. Two versions of this classicism are represented by these two tracts, however. The first, Purism, has a modem, streamlined look, and speaks the language of science and of general laws, such as proportion. It argues that the artist-designer should dedicate himself to industry, producing for it the generalized types associated with classical forms. The second has a reactionary, Old Master character and recycles the themes and genres of the neoclassical art it wishes to revive. The mother-and-child theme became a preferred one-taken up by former Cubists such as Gino Severini as well as modified ones such as Albert Gleizes-as did the tradition of the commedia del'arte. Severini's clowns and harlequins, painted in the early twenties in the hard outlines and licked surfaces of the most academicized classicism, are determined examples of the latter.

        Neoclassicism
      </h4>
      <p>
        Now understood to describe the classicizing style which evolved in European art of the later 18th and early 19th centuries in reaction to the florid sensuality of the Rococo. It embraced the fine and decorative arts and architecture, and its masters included the painter David (The Oath of the Horatii, Louvre, Paris), the sculptor Canova, and the architects Ledoux and Soane. The term was actually devised later, in the 1880s, and was originally pejorative, denoting 'pseudo-classical', and particularly directed at Jacques-Louis David and his school. Neoclassicism is now seen to have achieved a purity of expression, however, and would have been referred to by its practitioners as the 'true' or 'correct' style. It was based on the study of antique art, which was to be imitated but not slavishly copied, and thus embody what were perceived to be the general and permanent principles of the visual arts as formulated by the ancients. Its first great theorist was J. J. Winckelmann (1717–68), whose Reflections on the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks was published in English translation in 1765.

    <p>
      One way of making art can mean very different things depending on where and how it's made and shown. What might be transgressive and anti-establishment in Germany might, at the same time, be regressive in France.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dramatic political circumstances across European nations, on both the "winning" or "losing" sides of WWI, set the stage for very different kinds of artistic expression.

        Moreover, the social/political significance of an artwork often doesn't come from the piece itself but from what's done with it.
      </h5>
      <p>
        If a work of art does become a political symbol,
        then you- have to reckon that its significance will
        become and will remain a matter of dispute. The
        opposing side will try to incorporate it within its own
        political strategy, to appropriate it or at least to
        neutralise it. The political significance of a work of
        art is never given once and for all, it does not have a
        fixed ontological status, but must be reaffirmed and fought for over and over again.

</li>

<p>
  After Cubism's rapid and dramatic evolution from 1906 - 1913, and after Picasso et al's foray into figurative styles and classical themes during the "Return to Order," he settles into a more "mature style" - notwithstanding detours through Surrealism and other media.

    <h3>Some facts</h3>
    <h5>
      The Spanish Civil War
    </h5>
    <li>
      In January 1936, the Popular Front (a coalition of leftist political parties) won the 1936 election, forming the government of the Spanish Republic (the Republic was formed when the Monarchy was deposed in 1931). 
    </li>
    <li>
      In July 1936, right-wing military generals staged a partially failed coup against the Republican government, leading into a Civil War between the Republican (left-wing) and Nationalist (right-wing, monarchist) factions
    </li>
    <li>
      On April 26, 1937, Francisco Franco, leader of the Nationalist faction, with the Nazi German and Fascist Italian airforces, bombed the Basque town of Guernica. The civilian town was destroyed for no military purpose, but to practice aerial attacks and terrorize the population. Over 1600 people, a third of the town, were killed or wounded. 
    </li>
    <h5>
      The Creation of Guernica
    </h5>
    <li>
      Earlier in 1937, the Spanish Republican government commissioned Picasso to create a work for the Spanish pavilion at the International Exhibition in Paris.
    </li>
    <li>
      Like <em>Les Demoiselles d'Avignon</em> Picasso obsessively sketched and re-sketched different versions of it, changing the iconography and symbols.
    </li>
    <li>
      Following the International Exhibition, the painting toured around Western Europe, to raise funds for the Spanish Republican cause.
    </li>
    <li>
      In 1939, Guernica found it's temporary home at the MoMA, New York. Picasso stipulated that it would return to Spain only when Spain was restored to a democratic republic.
    </li>
    <li>
      In 1981, following the death of Franco, Guernica was installed at the Museo Prado, Madrid. Since 1992, it has been in the Museo Reina Sofia, Madrid.
    </li>
  </ul>

      Guernica iconography
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <p style="margin: 20vh auto 4rem auto;">
    Many of these icons appear in a series of etchings Picasso made in 1933-1935, based on the mythical figure of the minotaur (half-man half-bull, )

      <p>
        Much of what has made Guernica endure is its ambiguity - it speaks to specific conditions, but can also work as a more universal symbol of brutality and suffering.  
        Compare to this work by the Berlin Dada photomontage artist John Heartfield, which is much less ambiguous 
      </p>
      <p>
        "He did not take as his point of departure realistic images of the destruction of Guernica which were available, for example,
        in newspaper photographs. Furthermore, he never
        allowed himself to be committed to any unambi-
        guous political interpretation of the work's animal
        symbolism, even if it was clearly directed against
        Franco and the fascist assault on Spain. When asked
        whether the bull in Guernica stood for fascism, he
        denied this, and insisted that the bull signified rather
        a generalised 'darkness and brutality'.""

      In any art project, the important thing is to share and to witness. We have a situation in Palestine in general, and it's a very special situation, since in my view, we don't have a state. I was thinking about how art could be shown in such a complicated situation. In a way, we have two governments, we have lots of policemen, and we have lots of customs officers. We have everything like that, but we don't have a border, or at least borders that are firm. So I wanted to look at those things through an artwork and the checkpoints it comes through.... How do you bring an artwork into a war zone?

  <p><em>
    A letter of support for Manuel Borja-Villel and the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía has currently garnered over one thousand signatures, denouncing accusations in right-wing Spanish media about the politicization of the museum and administrative mismanagement, including irregularities in two of Borja-Villel's previous contract extensions (in 2013 and 2018). The letter states: “The success and notoriety of the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia in latter years has placed it in the midst of a hurried and manipulated 'cultural war,' surreptitiously unleashed by the outbreak of the extreme right in the Spanish political and media landscape … The extreme violence of the attacks perpetrated against Manuel Borja-Villel and those around him are proof that there is something more at stake than his tenure. These attacks are part of a defamatory campaign directed at the model the Museum represents.” Borja-Villel, who has served as the director for the last fifteen years, announced that he would not add his name to the list of candidates in the current public competition, which opens on February 1.

        Artforms are rarely created in isolation, modern art is largely the product of international encounters, born of travel and exchange.
      </h5>
      <p>
        Art history is full of people visiting different countries, absorbing art and writing that was unavailable elsewhere, then returning home to produce their own variants. These variants, in reflecting the context of their time and place, might then grow into new movements. This is especially true of modern art in the early 1900s, as artists across the world crossed paths with Cubism.

          Some context
        </h5>
        <p>
          Like France, Italy was caught up in nationalist fervour leading up to WWI. Unlike France, it hadn't shown much for itself in modern art, it still represented the art of Ancient Rome and the Renaissance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Italy was also an early adopter of Fascism, keen to expand its footprint through aggression. Unlike other dictators, Mussolini tolerated Avant-Garde modernism for awhile, which made for a rare confluence of far-right politics and progressive, experimental aesthetics.

            A work that is not aggressive in character cannot be a masterpiece ... We want to glorify war - the world's only hygiene - militarism, patriotism, the destructive act of the anarchists, the beautiful ideas for which one dies, and contempt for women. We want to destroy museums, libraries, and academies of all kinds, and to make war on moralism, feminism and on every opportunistic and utilitarian vileness. We shall sing the great crowds excited by work, pleasure or rioting, the multicoloured, many-voiced tides of
            revolution in modern capitals. We shall sing the nocturnal, vibrating incandescence of arsenals. and shipyards, ablaze with violent electric moons, the voracious stations devouring their smoking serpents ... the broadbreasted locomotives that paw the grounds of their rails like enormous horses of steel harnessed with tubes, and the smooth flight of the aeroplanes, their propellers flapping in the wind like flags and seeming to clap approval like an enthusiastic crowd.

            "in contradistinction to [the notion that painting and sculpture as "static arts"] Futurism strove to incorporate the experience of simultaneity, temporality, and bodily movement within the boundaries of the art object.

        In sum, Futurists sought art that expresses the novel experiences of 20th Century modernity - its new sights and sensations and ways of communicating.  
      </h5>
      
      
      <p>
        If Cubism responded to this condition by collapsing multiple spatial viewpoints into a flattened picture plane, and by playing with the linguistic structure of visual representation, Futurism sought to combine multiple visual moments in a single image, and to express the sensory immediacy of words and sounds.

      <div class="igBox">
        <p>
          What was Futurism offering to the world? Its basic views, amounting to an insistence that the growth of technology and concurrent developments in society and thought required expression in new, bold, art forms, were not unique but had never been presented so vehemently. Moreover, here was an art movement that put idea before style, thus challenging not only traditional artistic values but also the aesthetic ambitions of most avant-garde art. Futurist paintings tested and proved the possibility of using art as a means of capturing non-visual as well as visual aspects of an environment cognized as dynamic rather than static.

      In 1909, this means looking at experiments in photography, inventions in mechanical engineering (e.g. cars, electric street lighting) and publishing manifestos in Newspapers.

            <p>
              Carra's Interventionist Demonstration is a central example of the Futurist aesthetic as it came to a climax just before World War I. Indeed, the work incorporates all of the devices with which Futurism was most engaged: the legacy of divisionist painting; the Cubist fragmentation of traditional perceptual space; the insertion of clippings from newspapers and found mate rials from advertising; the suggestion of kinesthesia through a visual dynamic set up by the collage's construction as both a vortex and a matrix of crisscrossing power lines set as mutually counter-active diagonals; and last, but not least, the juxtaposition of the separate phonetic dimension of language with its graphic signifiers. ... The juxtaposition of anti-German war slogans ("Down with Austro-Hungary") with found advertising material, or the concatenation of Italian patriotic declarations ("Italia Italia") with musical fragments, continues the technique of Cubist collage but turns this aesthetic into a new model of mass-cultural instigation and propaganda.

          Futurism is essentially an acceleration of successive images, seen simultaneously, across a very shallow plain, as also was the 'cubo-futurism' of Marcel Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase. What Vorticism did was to extend this acceleration into depth, creating an intense, inrushing perspective - a vortex.

              At first glance Composition presents a compressed series of mechanical forms and abstract references to the modern city. However, it is possible to recognise traces of human figures. Dynamic thrusting shapes rise from the lower left but are contained within a claustrophobic, abstract environment. These forms can be seen as a dancing couple. The woman, on the right, bends backwards. The white parallelogram halfway up the right edge is perhaps her hair. The pleated curving architectural form at the bottom centre could be her skirt.

              Lewis had a particular interest in the modern city as a place of tensions. In this work two slanting forms resemble architectural structures. Their steep diagonal focus dominates the composition. However, like other works by Lewis from this period, the drawing communicates a strong feeling of instability, arrested motion and agitation. These abstracted urban forms are also suggestive of figures, perhaps caught in a lull in between actions.

              The subject of this painting is the hold of a ship, in which dock workers are handling heavy freight. However, Bomberg has divided the canvas into a grid of squares that are themselves divided. The effect of this is to shatter form, transforming the scene into a kinetic pattern of shape and dazzling colour. Though the image has become hard to decipher, the fragmented composition expresses the energy of men at work in an industrial environment.

              Bathing figures were a traditional way of depicting the nude, but here Bomberg brings the subject into the modern era by basing the scene on steam baths used by the local Jewish population near Bomberg’s home in east London. Bomberg was closely associated with a group of artists known as the vorticists. Their aim was to create art that expressed the modern world through imagery derived from machines and the urban environment. Here Bomberg reduces the human figure to a series of geometric shapes, a process he described as 'searching for an intenser expression … where I use Naturalistic Form I have stripped it of all irrelevant matter.'

              Very little of Wadsworth’s early work survives. He made this gouache in woodland near Lewes in Sussex, when he was twenty-four. He was exploring ideas about the depiction of form and space derived from Cézanne and Cubism. Wadsworth rarely produced pastoral landscapes like this; his later work was to be dominated by industrial, urban and maritime imagery.

              Sharp diagonal lines converge towards a focal point. This painting recalls the poet Ezra Pound’s description of the vortex as ‘absorbing all that is around it in a violent whirling’. The vorticist group’s aggressive rhetoric, angular style and focus on the energy of modern life were similar to Italian futurism. However, they did not share the futurists’ emphasis on speed, or their romanticisation of technology. Wadsworth and the other vorticists had a more matter-of-fact attitude to the machine age. Their images betray little sense of celebratory excitement.

          This brutal energy was characteristic of Vorticism. At their best the Vorticists achieved a strong visualization of the headlong flight of Europe into mechanical barbarity, an awareness of the brutalization of man by his irresponsible control of his environment that is lacking in the idealized art of Cubism and the romanticized art of
          Futurism. This, and the acceleration of forms into depth, was the significant contribution of Vorticism to the art of the twentieth century.

          United States might have possessed the prized icons of modernity, but its artists lacked the privileged styles of modernism. As a result they felt at once benighted and belated in relation to European modernists, a condition that complicated the transatlantic travel of artists in the teens and twenties… Discontent with the messy realism of their elder compatriots, some American artists voyaged to Europe to seek out modernist art, while others had already seen such work in New York at the controversial Armory Show.... Indeed, the North American encounter with modernism occurred mostly in the States, where Duchamp, Picabia and others had fled during World War I. At the time New York was the interim capital of the avant-garde...

              Davis typically painted local modern subjects in rhythmic compositions with bold colors. Among his sources of inspiration were “skyscraper architecture; the brilliant colors on gasoline stations; chain store fronts and taxicabs” and jazz music. Long before postwar artists mined the world of trademark brands, Davis incorporated imagery from logos, commercial signage, and packaging into his paintings, such as the branded bag of tobacco in Lucky Strike. Championed by the visionary dealer Edith Halpert at her Downtown Gallery, Davis’s work was met with both enthusiasm and confusion despite being engaged with the stuff and forms of modern life in New York in the 1920s.          </p>

                Influenced by the Cubist language of flat, overlapping planes and wedges, Davis used geometric shapes in related colors to create this still life. Here, he deconstructs the cylindrical forms of a mass-produced, percolator coffeepot and renders the everyday object both abstract and identifiable. By choosing an industrially produced consumer product as his subject, Davis put a new spin on the spatial innovations of the previous decade's European avant-garde art movements.

                  In the early 1920s, the photographer Paul Strand proposed a film project to Charles Sheeler (his collaborator on the 1920 film Manhatta) involving the New York Yacht Club. Never a sportsman, Sheeler may have studied the sailboats at the yacht club in anticipation of this never-realized film. One of several works on this subject, the Cubist-inspired Pertaining to Yachts and Yachting eloquently suggests the swift movement of several large vessels in the ocean, giving the viewer what one scholar called a "full yachting experience."

                  Completed in 1914, The Aero may have been the painting that Marsden Hartley described in a letter to his dealer, Alfred Stieglitz, the previous year: “I have one canvas ‘Extase d’Aéroplane’ if it must have a title—it is my notion of the possible ecstasy or soul state of an aéroplane if it could have one.” The artist was thrilled when he saw zeppelins, or huge airships, flying overhead. Both Europeans and Americans keenly followed advances in aviation, and Germany was swept by “zeppelin fever.” In the years leading up to the outbreak of World War I, potential rivals were concerned that Germany would build an air fleet capable of bombarding its enemies and transporting troops to distant places, even New York City. Yet Hartley did not address the potential danger; instead he presents an exuberant interpretation of one of the greatest inventions of the modern era.

                  Hartley lived in Berlin from May 1913 to December 1915, a period interrupted only by a four-month trip to New York from November 1913 to March 1914. Hartley’s imagery from this time has been widely acknowledged as constituting one of the most original new visual languages of modern art that emerged during the first two decades of the 20th century. Hartley combined the influences of fauvism, cubism, and German expressionism with his own mystical vision to create colorful abstract compositions that reflect his fascination with modern life in Berlin, especially the German military. The Aero is an energetic, colorful abstract painting that registers the influences of avant-garde art movements and alludes to one of the most revolutionary technological advances of the time.

                Demuth completed eight symbolic portraits between 1924 and 1929 as tributes to modern American artists, writers, and performers. Though not a physical likeness, Demuth created this portrait of his friend, the poet and physician William Carlos Williams, using imagery from Williams’s poem The Great Figure, which evokes the sights and sounds of a fire engine speeding down the street. The intersecting lines, repeated "5," round forms of the numbers, lights, street lamp, and blaring sirens of the red fire engine together infuse the painting with a vibrant, urban energy. Demuth derived the title from the poem, which reads:
                <br><br>
                Among the rain <br>
                and lights <br>

                to gong clangs <br>
                siren howls <br>

                My Egypt depicts a steel and concrete grain elevator belonging to John W. Eshelman & Sons in Charles Demuth’s hometown of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Painted from a low vantage point, the structure assumes a monumentality emphasized by the inclusion of the lower rooftops of neighboring buildings (suggesting the more traditional architecture of smaller family farms) at the bottom of the painting. In Demuth’s image, the majestic grain elevator rises up as the pinnacle of American achievement—a modern day equivalent to the monuments of ancient Egypt. A series of intersecting diagonal planes add geometric dynamism add a heavenly radiance to the composition, invoking the correlations between industry and religion that were widespread in the 1920s. Nonetheless, Demuth may have intended the title to allude to the slave labor that built the pyramids, intimating the dehumanizing effect of industry on the nation’s workers. Moreover, the pyramids and their association with life after death might also have appealed to the ailing artist, who was bedridden with diabetes at the time of the painting’s execution.

                In 1964, after three decades of living and working in Harlem, Bearden took up collage, cutting and combining found images and photographs to achieve new combinations defined by their fragmentation, texture, and layered depth. He used this approach to capture the complex facets of Black experience in the United States, often depicting scenes from everyday life in the rural South, which many African Americans left to move to northern cities during the Great Migration (1916–70), and scenes from Harlem. Throughout his career, Bearden reworked his own images in different mediums, including this collage, which is shown alongside a later photo reproduction.

        The experimentation that took them through synthetic cubism, collage, and construction brought them to a kind of cul-de-sac. As Picasso & Braque reverted to more conventional styles, and as their peers followed their work by developing different strains of painting and sculpture, both abstract and figurative, artists in Eastern Europe would do much to build on and advance the line of experimentation Cubism started.

      <h3>
        Modernity in Eastern Europe: A new art for a new subject for a new society
      </h3>
      
      <p>
        If the Western experience of modernity was shaped by the "shock" of rapid urbanization, industrialization, and technological change—that is, by the manifestations of capitalist development—Russian modernism was shaped by the societal transformations surrounding the Revolution of 1917-23.   
      </p>
      <p>
        That meant much more emphasis on rejecting older, bourgeois notions of art, combined with attempts to create art forms that would play an active role in constructing a new society. This made for art that was much more <em>formal</em> in both method and style.
      </p>
      <p>
        Russian modernism was also tuned into linguistic and literary theory (so called Russian Formalism), which was concerned with the construction of meaning through signs.
      </p>
      
      <div class="igBox">
        <p>
          The "crisis in representation signaled by Cubism... had revealed a truth about "bourgeois" art, both academic and avant-garde, to which the (Duchamp and Vladimir Tatlin - more on him later) were also responding-that it was presumed to be autonomous, separate from social life, an instituion in its own right.... Once valued as the sign of artistic freedom, according to (theorist Peter Burger), this autonomy had become the mark of its "social ineffectuality," and this in turn prompted "the self-critique of art" advanced paradigmatically by Duchamp and Tatlin.

        <p>
          "Right from the start, the issue at stake [for Russian Formalists, such as Roman Jakobson and Viktor Shklovsky] seems to have been: "What is it that makes a work literary; what is literariness as such?" </p>
          <cite>
            (We can likewise ask what makes and artwork art?)
          </cite>
          <p>
            The question was polemical, directed against almost any trend of
            literary studies at the time: against the Symbolists, for whom the
            text was a transparent vehicle for a transcendent image; against the
            positivists and the psychologists, for whom the biography of tbe
            writer or his putative intention were the determining factors; and against the sociologists, for whom the truth of a literary text was to be found in the historical context of its formation and the political·ideological content it conveyed. For the Formalists, the literariness of a text was a product of its structure, from the phonetical level to the syntactic, from the microsemantic unit of the word to that of the plot. The literary text to them was an organized whole, whose elements
            and devices had first to be analyzed, almost in a chemical fashion
            (" isolated and laid bare just as they are in a Cubist painting," as
            Jakobson wrote) befo re anything could be said of its signification." ...
            The real source of this parallel was the belief on the part of painter
            and critic alike in the power of art to renew perception. For the Formalist critic this meant showing how an author's use of language differs from our ordinary use, how commonsense language is "made strange" within the text; Shklovsky called such a critical move one oflaying bare the aesthetic "device." For the painter this
            meant "de-automatizing" vision so as to confront the viewer with
            the fact that pictorial signs are not transparent to their referents
            but have an existence of their own, that they are "palpable," as
            Jakobson would say.

          The Zero-Degree of Painting
        </h4>

          The founding moment of Suprematism occurred in December 1915, at the "0.10" exhibition in Petrograd (subtitled "The Last Futurist Exhibition of Paintings," the show owes its name to the fact that its ten participants-including Vladimir Tatlin, who showed his first corner counter-reli ef th ere- were all seeking to determine the "zero degree," the irreducible core, the essential minimum of painting or of sculpture).

            Suprematism
          </h4>
          <p>
            A term coined by Russian artist Kazimir Malevich in 1915 to describe a new mode of abstract painting that abandoned all reference to the outside world. His new style claimed <strong>"the supremacy of pure feeling or perception in the pictorial arts"</strong> and rejected the deliberate illusions of representational painting. Using the basic components of painting’s language—color, line, and brushwork—he constructed a visual vocabulary of colored geometric shapes floating against white backgrounds, which he felt mapped the boundless space of the ideal.

            From Cubist Construction to Constructivism
          </h4>
          
          <div class="igBox">
            <p>
              Constructivism was a particularly austere branch of abstract art founded by Vladimir Tatlin and Alexander Rodchenko in Russia around 1915
            </p>
            <p>
              The constructivists believed art should directly reflect the modern industrial world. Vladimir Tatlin was crucially influenced by Pablo Picasso’s cubist constructions (Construction 1914) which he saw in Picasso’s studio in Paris in 1913. These were three-dimensional still lifes made of scrap materials. Tatlin began to make his own but they were completely abstract and made of industrial materials.
            </p>
            <p>
              By 1921 Russian artists who followed Tatlin’s ideas were calling themselves constructivists and in 1923 a manifesto was published in their magazine Lef:
            </p>
            <p class="mini">
              The material formation of the object is to be substituted for its aesthetic combination. The object is to be treated as a whole and thus will be of no discernible ‘style’ but simply a product of an industrial order like a car, an aeroplane and such like. Constructivism is a purely technical mastery and organisation of materials.
            </p>
            <p>
              Constructivism was suppressed in Russia in the 1920s but was brought to the West by Naum Gabo and his brother Antoine Pevsner and has been a major influence on modern sculpture.

                  Tatlin is already on the threshold of Constructivism. The frame remains, but the materials are no longer composed pictorially. An iron triangle projects into space, in contrast with a wooden rod set at an angle in the stucco surface; below and above are two further juxtapositions of curved metal and cut glass. Selection has the character of a demonstration: it first lists its materials, then allows intrinsic properties to suggest appropriate forms. "The material dictates the forms, and not the opposite," critic Nikolai Tarabukin wrote in a 1916 definition of Constructivism based on such works. "Wood, metal, glass, etc. impose different constructions." For Tatlin, machined wood was square and planar, and so suggested rectilinear forms; metal could be cut and bent, and so suggested curvilinear forms; glass was somewhere in between, with a transparency that might also mediate between interior and exterior surfaces. How different this materialism is from the ambiguity of Cubist constructions! Far from the "arbitrary," Tatlin sought to make his constructions "necessary" through this "truth to materials," an ur-modernist aesthetic that tended also to be an ethics and, after the Russian Revolution, a politics as well.

              "What happened from the social aspect in 1917," (Vladimir) Tatlin wrote, "was realized in our work as pictorial artists in 1914, when 'materials, volume, and construction' were accepted as our foundations." Such materialist foundations were achieved in Constructivist art, Tatlin implies, before they were established in Communist society.

                <p>
                  After 1914 Tatlin adopted the term "counter-relief," as if to
                  signal a dialectical advance in his constructions: just as the first
                  "painterly reliefs" exceeded painting, so the new "counter-reliefs,"
                  which extended from the wall, exceeded the painterly reliefs.
                  Sometimes these counter-reliefs were suspended across corners
                  with axial wires and rods [3). These "corner counter-reliefs" were
                  
                  complex constructions of metal planes, squared and curved, per pendicular and angular. Not painting, sculpture, or architecture, they were "counters" to all three arts that activated materials, spaces, and viewers in new ways. First shown in December 1915 at
                  "0.10: The Last Futurist Exhibition of Paintings" in Petrograd
                  (once St. Petersburg, soon to be Leningrad), where Tatlin vied
                  with Kazimir Malevich for leadership of the Russian avant-garde,
                  the counter-reliefs drew young artists into the experimental
                  ("laboratory") phase of Constructivism. If the painterly reliefs
                  
                  advanced the Constructivist notion of faktura, which, in contra-
                  distinction to Western "facture", stressed the mechanical aspect of
                  
                  the painterly mark rather than its subjective side, the counter-
                  reliefs advanced the Constructivist notion of construction, which,
                  
                  in opposition to Western "composition," stressed active engage-
                  ment with art rather than contemplative reflection of it. Yet to be
                  
                  developed was the third notion of Constructivism, tectonics, the
                  dialectical connection of Constructivist formal experimentation
                  with Communist principles of socioeconomic organization, but
                  this most difficult step in the Constructivist program had to await
                  the Revolution.

        The experimentation that took them through synthetic cubism, collage, and construction brought them to a kind of cul-de-sac. As Picasso & Braque reverted to more conventional styles, and as their peers followed their work by developing different strains of painting and sculpture, both abstract and figurative, artists in Eastern Europe would do much to build on and advance the line of experimentation Cubism started.

        Modernity in Eastern Europe: A new art for a new subject for a new society
      </h3>
      
      <p>
        If the Western experience of modernity was shaped by the "shock" of rapid urbanization, industrialization, and technological change—that is, by the manifestations of capitalist development—Russian modernism was shaped by the societal transformations surrounding the Revolution of 1917-23.   
      </p>
      <p>
        That meant much more emphasis on rejecting older, bourgeois notions of art, combined with attempts to create art forms that would play an active role in constructing a new society. This made for art that was much more <em>formal</em> in both method and style.
      </p>
      <p>
        Russian modernism was also tuned into linguistic and literary theory (so called Russian Formalism), which was concerned with the construction of meaning through signs.
      </p>
      
      <div class="igBox">
        <p>
          The "crisis in representation signaled by Cubism... had revealed a truth about "bourgeois" art, both academic and avant-garde, to which the (Duchamp and Vladimir Tatlin - more on him later) were also responding-that it was presumed to be autonomous, separate from social life, an instituion in its own right.... Once valued as the sign of artistic freedom, according to (theorist Peter Burger), this autonomy had become the mark of its "social ineffectuality," and this in turn prompted "the self-critique of art" advanced paradigmatically by Duchamp and Tatlin.

          "Right from the start, the issue at stake [for Russian Formalists, such as Roman Jakobson and Viktor Shklovsky] seems to have been: "What is it that makes a work literary; what is literariness as such?" </p>
          <cite>
            (We can likewise ask what makes and artwork art?)
          </cite>
          <p>
            The question was polemical, directed against almost any trend of
            literary studies at the time: against the Symbolists, for whom the
            text was a transparent vehicle for a transcendent image; against the
            positivists and the psychologists, for whom the biography of tbe
            writer or his putative intention were the determining factors; and against the sociologists, for whom the truth of a literary text was to be found in the historical context of its formation and the political·ideological content it conveyed. For the Formalists, the literariness of a text was a product of its structure, from the phonetical level to the syntactic, from the microsemantic unit of the word to that of the plot. The literary text to them was an organized whole, whose elements
            and devices had first to be analyzed, almost in a chemical fashion
            (" isolated and laid bare just as they are in a Cubist painting," as
            Jakobson wrote) befo re anything could be said of its signification." ...
            The real source of this parallel was the belief on the part of painter
            and critic alike in the power of art to renew perception. For the Formalist critic this meant showing how an author's use of language differs from our ordinary use, how commonsense language is "made strange" within the text; Shklovsky called such a critical move one oflaying bare the aesthetic "device." For the painter this
            meant "de-automatizing" vision so as to confront the viewer with
            the fact that pictorial signs are not transparent to their referents
            but have an existence of their own, that they are "palpable," as
            Jakobson would say.

          The Zero-Degree of Painting

          The founding moment of Suprematism occurred in December 1915, at the "0.10" exhibition in Petrograd (subtitled "The Last Futurist Exhibition of Paintings," the show owes its name to the fact that its ten participants-including Vladimir Tatlin, who showed his first corner counter-reli ef th ere- were all seeking to determine the "zero degree," the irreducible core, the essential minimum of painting or of sculpture).

          </h4>
          <p>
            A term coined by Russian artist Kazimir Malevich in 1915 to describe a new mode of abstract painting that abandoned all reference to the outside world. His new style claimed <strong>"the supremacy of pure feeling or perception in the pictorial arts"</strong> and rejected the deliberate illusions of representational painting. Using the basic components of painting’s language—color, line, and brushwork—he constructed a visual vocabulary of colored geometric shapes floating against white backgrounds, which he felt mapped the boundless space of the ideal.

            From Cubist Construction to Constructivism
          </h4>
          
          <div class="igBox">
            <p>
              Constructivism was a particularly austere branch of abstract art founded by Vladimir Tatlin and Alexander Rodchenko in Russia around 1915
            </p>
            <p>
              The constructivists believed art should directly reflect the modern industrial world. Vladimir Tatlin was crucially influenced by Pablo Picasso’s cubist constructions (Construction 1914) which he saw in Picasso’s studio in Paris in 1913. These were three-dimensional still lifes made of scrap materials. Tatlin began to make his own but they were completely abstract and made of industrial materials.
            </p>
            <p>
              By 1921 Russian artists who followed Tatlin’s ideas were calling themselves constructivists and in 1923 a manifesto was published in their magazine Lef:
            </p>
            <p class="mini">
              The material formation of the object is to be substituted for its aesthetic combination. The object is to be treated as a whole and thus will be of no discernible ‘style’ but simply a product of an industrial order like a car, an aeroplane and such like. Constructivism is a purely technical mastery and organisation of materials.
            </p>
            <p>
              Constructivism was suppressed in Russia in the 1920s but was brought to the West by Naum Gabo and his brother Antoine Pevsner and has been a major influence on modern sculpture.

                  Tatlin is already on the threshold of Constructivism. The frame remains, but the materials are no longer composed pictorially. An iron triangle projects into space, in contrast with a wooden rod set at an angle in the stucco surface; below and above are two further juxtapositions of curved metal and cut glass. Selection has the character of a demonstration: it first lists its materials, then allows intrinsic properties to suggest appropriate forms. "The material dictates the forms, and not the opposite," critic Nikolai Tarabukin wrote in a 1916 definition of Constructivism based on such works. "Wood, metal, glass, etc. impose different constructions." For Tatlin, machined wood was square and planar, and so suggested rectilinear forms; metal could be cut and bent, and so suggested curvilinear forms; glass was somewhere in between, with a transparency that might also mediate between interior and exterior surfaces. How different this materialism is from the ambiguity of Cubist constructions! Far from the "arbitrary," Tatlin sought to make his constructions "necessary" through this "truth to materials," an ur-modernist aesthetic that tended also to be an ethics and, after the Russian Revolution, a politics as well.

              "What happened from the social aspect in 1917," (Vladimir) Tatlin wrote, "was realized in our work as pictorial artists in 1914, when 'materials, volume, and construction' were accepted as our foundations." Such materialist foundations were achieved in Constructivist art, Tatlin implies, before they were established in Communist society.

                  After 1914 Tatlin adopted the term "counter-relief," as if to
                  signal a dialectical advance in his constructions: just as the first
                  "painterly reliefs" exceeded painting, so the new "counter-reliefs,"
                  which extended from the wall, exceeded the painterly reliefs.
                  Sometimes these counter-reliefs were suspended across corners
                  with axial wires and rods [3). These "corner counter-reliefs" were
                  
                  complex constructions of metal planes, squared and curved, per pendicular and angular. Not painting, sculpture, or architecture, they were "counters" to all three arts that activated materials, spaces, and viewers in new ways. First shown in December 1915 at
                  "0.10: The Last Futurist Exhibition of Paintings" in Petrograd
                  (once St. Petersburg, soon to be Leningrad), where Tatlin vied
                  with Kazimir Malevich for leadership of the Russian avant-garde,
                  the counter-reliefs drew young artists into the experimental
                  ("laboratory") phase of Constructivism. If the painterly reliefs
                  
                  advanced the Constructivist notion of faktura, which, in contra-
                  distinction to Western "facture", stressed the mechanical aspect of
                  
                  the painterly mark rather than its subjective side, the counter-
                  reliefs advanced the Constructivist notion of construction, which,
                  
                  in opposition to Western "composition," stressed active engage-
                  ment with art rather than contemplative reflection of it. Yet to be
                  
                  developed was the third notion of Constructivism, tectonics, the
                  dialectical connection of Constructivist formal experimentation
                  with Communist principles of socioeconomic organization, but
                  this most difficult step in the Constructivist program had to await
                  the Revolution.

      Art History is a discpline founded on Western cultural and intellectual foundations. And while it has spread to instutions all over the world, those foundations inform how the history of art is written. This is particularly true when it comes to the notion of <strong>influence</strong> and of <strong>"centre and periphery."</strong>  
    </h5>
    
    <p>
      Outside the centre of the Western art "world," peripheral practices are often doomed to be looked down on as derivative (just copying Western styles that were invented decades before), or as "lower art" (e.g. as folk art / craft / design or other kinds of "fine art"). And when they're not, they're often regarded as anomalies or are exoticised.

        "Art since 1900 touches on a few isolated samples of postwar diaspora art and Asian avant-garde movements, but these owe their presence more to what they mean to the West than for their intrinsic worth. In consequence, they tend to come off as bit players in the master narrative. Thus, despite the above inclusions, the canon is not significantly enlarged. Rather, the non-Western artists are brought in primarily on account of their compatibility with the avant-garde discourse in the West."

      <p>
        By talking about these artists in terms of their relation to Cubism (or Western modernism), we're already caught in a trap that positions them as "peripheral." How can we talk about these artists from a perspective that is both local and global, without also making them a placeholder for their nationality/ethnicity?
      </p>
      
      <h5>
        Or as Partha Mitter writes:
      </h5>
      
      <p>
        "we must seek explanatory tools that adequately describe art practices and their social and cultural milieus in the so-called outlying areas, taking into account the peculiar contextual needs and expressions of regional artistic productions and consumptions, along with the local assertions of global concerns."
      </p>
      
      <p>
        And to...
      </p>
      
      <p>
        "pay closer attention to particular art histories, the contexts of their ideologies, contradictions, and fractures in their engagement with modernity. To my mind, multiple local possibilities illuminate the global processes of modernity more effectively than a grand globalizing narrative, which is more likely than not to perpetuate a relationship of power."
      </p>
      
      <p> 
        In short, this means NOT regarding the history of art as a unified, linear path led by Europeans and Americans, with non-Western artists showing up late to the game with inferior copies. Instead, we can look at the multi-directional exchange of influence ("the global process of cross-fertilization"), in which the adoption of foreign styles means different things in different contexts.

        The "enormous achievements of the heroic age of the avant-garde cannot be gainsaid, as the modernist technology of art, not to mention the formal language and syntax of Cubism, allowed artists in far-flung regions to devise new ways to image the visible world. One of the favorite projects of the colonial powers in the nineteenth century was to inculcate "good taste" in the subject nations through the introduction of academic naturalism and classical standards. Therefore, the revolt of the Western avant-garde against academic naturalism and its attendant ideology was openly welcomed by the subject nations, who were concerned with formulating their own resistance to the colonial order."

      Gaganendranath Tagore
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      Gaganendranath Tagore (17 September 1867 – 14 February 1938)[1] was an Bengali painter and cartoonist of the Bengal school. Along with his brother Abanindranath Tagore, he was counted as one of the earliest modern artists in India.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between 1920 and 1925, Gaganendranath pioneered experiments in modernist painting.[3] Partha Mitter describes him as "the only Indian painter before the 1940s who made use of the language and syntax of Cubism in his painting".[4] From 1925 onwards, the artist developed a complex post-cubist style.

          Analytic Cubism, which destroyed the conventions of illusionistic naturalism, helped to restore the internal cohesion of a picture so that it ceased to be a window on the external world. Artists worldwide were drawn to Cubism's flexible nonfigurative syntax, which could be put to different uses, but they were not concerned with the formal revolution of Analytic Cubism as such.
        </p>
        <p>
          ...the use of Cubism, a product of the dominant West, by an Indian artist who belonged to the colonized world, immediately locked him into a dependent relationship, the colonized mimicking the superior art of the colonizer. Archer's analysis of modern art in India rests on reductionist criteria employed by art historians to describe the reception of Western art in the periphery: while successful imitation was a form of aping, imperfect imitation represented a failure of learning.

          Diego Rivera
        </h2>
        <p>
          Rivera is best known for leading the more formally conventional Mexican Mural movement of the 20s and 30s* (see the work on the right for reference), which eclipses his earlier participation in Cubism. Rivera was working throughout Europe in the first half of the 1910s; most notably, he moved to Paris in 1912 where he was acquainted with artists such as Picasso, Piet Mondriaan, and others. Rivera, watching the Mexican Revolution unfold from abroad, absorbed the formal experiments of the Parisian art scene while developing a visual style and iconography to match the new post-revolutionary Mexican identity.

            In the distinct brand of Cubism that he developed while living temporarily in Paris, Rivera used small dots of color, a technique known as Pointillism, to amplify contrasts in texture and pattern. Here, the sleek bottle of green liquid, presumably absinthe, and shiny metal spoon, necessary for preparing the potent drink, are paired against a strip of camouflage tablecloth, a reference to World War I. Additionally, he includes references to his homeland, such as the cigar box with a partial label reading BENITO JUA underneath a miniature Mexican landscape. This label refers to Benito Juárez, the President of Mexico from 1858 until his death in 1872.

        <span class="hoverCap">
          <p>
            Learning from Pablo Picasso, with whom he socialized during a lengthy sojourn in Paris in the 1910s, Rivera applied the Spaniard's groundbreaking Cubist style to a riveting representation of Emiliano Zapata Salazar.
          </p>
          <p>
            Zapata was leader of a critically important peasant revolt south of Mexico City during the Mexican revolution. Rivera applied Picasso's Cubism — a revolution in seeing — to a revolutionary subject.
          </p>
          <p>
            His image is loosely based on a widely circulated photograph of Zapata, his hand brandishing a rifle at his side. He wears a broad-brimmed sombrero, a striped serape and cartridge belts crisscrossed over his body.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rivera's fractured Cubist planes capture all these scrappy elements in a tight, central cluster that, while not exactly forming a figure, nonetheless suggests a human torso and head. Four feet tall, the canvas creates an inescapable bodily correspondence between the revolutionary Cubist figure being depicted and its observant viewer. Shifting Cubist planes of vibrant color set the figure in action.
          </p>
          <p>
            Several depicted objects are more realist, which adds to the visual disjunction. One is the rifle, its narrow, steel-gray form enlarged and pushed into the visual foreground by a sharply delineated white shape, which cuts across the composition on a diagonal. Behind it is a wood-grained ammunition box, which slyly corresponds to Zapata's body.
          </p>
          <p>
            The landscape is another realist element. Behind the nominal figure is a ghostly volcanic mountain range like the one that encircles Mexico City and, over the figure's shoulder on the right, what might be mesas or possibly chopped tree stumps. Two clumps of leafy green trees, one on each side of the torso, are placed like ornamental epaulets on a soldier's uniform.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bright blue sky across the lower half is matched by a sickly greenish veil above the mountains on top. Topsy-turvy colors signifying earth and sky together evoke a world turned upside down.
          </p>
          <p>
            The painting was produced early in a celebrated career that would expand for four decades. Yet it's no wonder Rivera described it as “probably the most faithful expression of the Mexican mood that I have ever achieved.” Cubism isn't known for expressing feeling, which makes Rivera's work distinctive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Needless to say, the landscape in “Zapatista Landscape” is of extreme importance. Agrarian reform was a crucial aim of the Mexican Revolution that was unfolding while Rivera was abroad. Territorial takeover in the Spanish conquest of Mexico had evolved over centuries into a system of vast private estates controlled by a small class of powerful landowners.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nineteenth-century Mexican landscape painting sought to fuse national identity with the land, just like similar imagery in other North American and European art. Zapata's peasant revolt in rural Morelos hinged on the refusal of the Mexican government to enact the agrarian reforms that had been demanded and, tentatively at least, promised. Rivera's Cubist masterpiece, painted when he was just 29, brilliantly fuses the land, revolution and the peasantry — with Zapata as its modern emblem.

    <h2>
      Wifredo Lam
    </h2>
    <p>
      A true one-of-a-kind artist, Lam embodies the notion of hybridity. Born and raised in Cuba, of mixed Chinese, European, Indian, and African ancestry, raised Catholic but interested in Afro-Caribbean spirituality, Lam studied art in Spain and established his career in Paris, where he was exposed to styles such as Cubism and Surrealism. 
    </p>

          <p>
            Lam, who had spent three years working with the Surrealists in Paris, aimed for The Jungle to convey the haunting consequences of slavery and colonialism for his native island of Cuba. He depicted figures with crescent-shaped faces, recalling African or Pacific Islander masks, against a background of Cuban sugarcane fields. Cuba, one of the world's largest sugar exporters, had been colonized since the sixteenth century, and the Atlantic slave trade had brought more than a million Africans there as labor for the country's plantations. “I wanted with all my heart to paint the drama of my country,” Lam wrote, “to disturb the dreams of the exploiters.”

          <p>
            [After moving to Spain from Havana in 1923], Lam experienced European artistic practices firsthand, working and studying with radical, nonconformist painters and absorbing early influences from the compositions of Paul Cézanne and Paul Gauguin during regular visits to museums. He moved to Paris in 1938, where he met Pablo Picasso. The elder artist became his friend and supporter, introducing him into his circle of Cubists and other avant-garde artists. In 1939, Lam met poet and founder of Surrealism André Breton and became associated with the Surrealist movement, which affected his style. Working mainly in gouache, he began painting fantastical figures with fragmented, geometrical bodies and often with a combination of human and animal parts and faces resembling the African carvings that so fascinated him and his peers.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1941, Lam returned to Cuba. Moved by the hardships of his country's black population and fascinated by their worship rituals, he aimed to express their culture through his art. He blended elements of Cubism, Surrealism, African, and Afro-Cuban art in paintings that became further dominated by his combined human-animal figures, which seemed to fuse with the lush, tropical flora that sometimes surrounded them.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1943, Wifredo Lam was in the midst of re-acquainting himself with his native Cuba, especially its population of African descent. “I wanted with all my heart to paint the drama of my country, but by thoroughly expressing the black spirit, the beauty of the plastic art of the blacks,” he once said. “I knew I was running the risk of not being understood. … But a true picture has the power to set the imagination to work even if it takes time.”2 The “true picture” of which he spoke is his monumental painting The Jungle (1943).
          </p>
          <p>
            Lam painted The Jungle during a flowering of interest in Afro-Cuban traditions by writers, artists, and intellectuals. The artist's own family included people of African descent. Already immersed in African art during his time in Paris, in Cuba he began to frequent Santería ceremonies. Originally enslaved by Spanish and Portuguese traders and brought to the island to work its sugarcane fields, Africans were forced to abandon their native beliefs and convert to Catholicism. In response, they overlaid their own traditions onto Catholicism (creating Santería), while continuing to practice their religions, such as Voodoun, in secret, in such hidden settings as the jungle that crowds Lam's painting.
          </p>
          <p>
            In The Jungle, Lam blends Afro-Cuban and African artistic and cultural traditions with the European modernist movements of Cubism and Surrealism. At nearly eight feet high by just over seven-and-a-half feet wide, this gouache on paper and canvas composition can feel immersive, or engulfing. Four part-human, part-animal figures, with exaggerated hands and feet and faces recalling African masks, stand side-by-side. In Cubist fashion, their bodies are fragmented into individual parts that do not seem to fit together logically. With their fantastic appearance, they seem as if they could have sprung from the artist's dreams or possibly from his unconscious, the workings of the mind that especially interested the Surrealists.
          </p>
          <p>
            The figures seem to simultaneously emerge from and merge with a dense wall of vegetation composed of thick, banded stalks suggestive of the sugarcane that grew in the fields the slaves worked. The rightmost figure holds a pair of shears, a possible reference to harvesting, while the leftmost figure, with its horse-like features, could be seen to hint at one of the spirits in Afro-Cuban mysticism. Since Lam chose a color palette of blues and greens, with touches of yellow and white, this could be read as a moonlit night scene, or as taking place during the day, under the cover of the deep shade of the jungle.

          <p>
            When Wifredo Lam arrived in Paris in 1938 he carried a letter of introduction to Pablo Picasso, with whom he had an immediate rapport. Soon he met many other leading artistic figures, among them André Breton, the dominant publicist and theorist of Surrealism. The Surrealists, who attempted to unleash the power of the unconscious through explorations of dream states and automatist writing, were fascinated by the mythologies of “primitive” people. They subscribed to an anthropology that perceived modern “primitive” cultures as the heirs to an integrated understanding of myth and reality, which they hoped to achieve themselves. Lam, as a Cuban of African, Chinese, and European descent, seemed to the Surrealists to have privileged access to that undifferentiated state of mind. In 1942 the artist returned to Cuba, where he constructed a body of work in a Surrealist idiom, creating symbolic creatures engaged in ritual acts of initiation. Lam's vocabulary of vegetal-animal forms was inspired by Afro-Cuban and Haitian Santeria deities. He also associated with the nationalist poets of the Négritude movement, who relied in their work on the images and rhythms of their native culture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rumblings of the Earth represents a synthesis of Lam's concerns in his work of the 1940s. This painting melds his reaction to the European artistic legacy with his own goals and the indigenous traditions of his country. Here, Lam referred to Picasso's 1937 Guernica through direct quotations and more abstract correspondences, but he transformed Picasso's political statement by replacing the central victim of Guernica, the horse, with a spectral presence bearing a large knife, described by Lam as “the instrument of integrity.” An aggressive painting, Rumblings of the Earth includes vaginal and phallic references that focus the work thematically on the cycle of birth and death while suggesting ritual initiation and violence. For Lam, revolutionary violence was a means of liberation; in his hands, the victim in Picasso's canvas has become the aggressor.
            
          </p>
          <p>
            In Zambezia, Zambezia Lam depicted an iconic woman partly inspired by the femme-cheval (horse-headed woman) of the Santeria cult. He frequently used the device of transmogrification of body parts to suggest magical metamorphosis, inspired by indigenous American and African ritual objects. In this painting it is manifested in the testicle “chin” of the figure.

    <h2>
      Tarsila do Amaral
    </h2>
    <p>
      “I want to be the painter of my country,” wrote Tarsila do Amaral (1886–1973) in 1923.... She studied piano, sculpture, and drawing before leaving for Paris in 1920 to attend the Académie Julian, the famous art school that drew many international students. During subsequent sojourns in the French capital, she studied with André Lhote, Albert Gleizes, and Fernand Léger, fulfilling what she called her "military service in Cubism," ultimately arriving at her signature style of sensuous, vibrant landscapes and everyday scenes. The exhibition (Tarisla do Amaral: Inventing Modern Art in Brazil) focuses on her pivotal production from the 1920s, when she navigated the art worlds of both São Paulo and Paris, and charts her involvement with an increasingly international artistic community, as well as her critical role in the emergence of modernism in Brazil. In 1928, she painted Abaporu for her husband, the poet Oswalde de Andrade, depicting an elongated, isolated figure with a blooming cactus. This landmark painting inspired the Manifesto of Anthropophagy, and became the banner for a transformative artistic movement, which imagined a specifically Brazilian culture arising from the symbolic digestion—or artistic “cannibalism”—of outside influences.

            Curator, Luis Perez-Oramas: Abaporu, a word constituted by two Tupi-Guarani words meaning "the man who eats human flesh," was painted by Tarsila in 1928 in order to be given as a birthday gift to her husband, Oswald de Andrade.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tarsila do Amaral: I wanted to make a picture that would startle Oswald, something really out of the ordinary. The Abaporu was that monstrous figure, the little head, the skinny little arm supported by an elbow, those enormous long legs, and next to it a cactus that looked like a sun, as if it were a flower and the sun at the same time. So, when he saw the picture, Oswald was extremely startled and asked, “But what is this? What an extraordinary thing!”
          </p>
          <p>
            ** Luis Perez-Oramas:** This painting actually became the signature illustration of the Anthropophagic Manifesto written by Oswald de Andrade. Anthropophagy, or cannibalistic practices, were documented among native Brazilians. In the 1920s avant-garde Paris, there was an obsession with cannibalistic practices from surrealist intellectuals and artists. Oswald took this motif of cannibalism to suggest symbolically ingesting artistic influences from both modern European art and traditional Brazilian culture. The aim was to produce a hybrid style that was distinctly new, and distinctly Brazilian.

          Mavo
        </h3>
        <p>
          Mavo was a radical Japanese art movement of the 1920s. Founded in 1923, Mavo was productive during the late Taishō period (1912–26). Mavo re-instituted the Japanese Association of Futurist Artists, the anarchistic artist group who displayed an outdoor exhibit in Ueno Park in Tokyo in protest of conservatism in the Japanese art world.[1]
          
        </p>
        <p>
          Led by Tomoyoshi Murayama, the group deployed an interdisciplinary array of performance art, painting, illustration and architecture, to communicate anti-establishment messages to the mainstream. Fueled by responses to industrial development, the Mavo group created works about crisis, peril and uncertainty. Art historian Gennifer Weisenfeld has written that Mavo sought to reintegrate art into daily life.[2]
          
        </p>
        <p>
          "Mavoist" artists sought to disrupt or blur the boundaries between art and daily life. They rebelled against the establishment by combining industrial products with painting or printmaking, usually in collage form. Their performance art protests against social injustice deployed theatrical eroticism, that mocked public norms for morality at the time.[3][2]

          Tomoyoshi Murayama
        </h3>
        <p>
          Tomoyoshi Murayama was a multi-disciplinary Japanese artist associated with the interwar avant-garde and leftwing theater movements. After briefly attending Tokyo Imperial University, Murayama moved to Berlin in 1922, where he met Herwarth Walden and participated in The Great Futurist Exhibition at the Galerie Der Sturm. Upon returning to Japan, Murayama held his first solo exhibition in Tokyo in 1923, where he developed a theory of ‘conscious constructivism’ that called for the incorporation of everyday life into aesthetic practice. As the founding member and spokesman of the art collective Mavo, Murayama challenged prevailing notions of pure art—his mixed media assemblages included references to popular culture and industrial materials. In addition to his mixed media pieces, Murayama produced work across a range of media including children’s illustration, commercial design, theater, and film. Murayama’s theater affiliations included the Kokoro-za Theatre and the New Cooperative Theatre, and he designed the constructivist-style set for the Tsukiji Little Theatre production of From Morning Till Midnight (1924). An active member of proletarian art associations, Murayama was detained multiple times under the Peace Preservation Law, and was forced to renounce his political affiliations in 1933. In 1940, the New Cooperative Theatre and New Tsukiji Little Theatre were disbanded, and Murayama imprisoned. Following his sentence, Murayama spent the remainder of the war in Korea and Manchuria, returning to Japan after the war in 1945. His late novel Shinobi no mono (1960–1962) was adapted as a film series, play, and television program. Prior to his death, he completed a four-volume autobiography.

      Today,... Cubism looks different - looks richer and more comprehensive than it did in 1914 - as a result of its recasting and expansion by painters, sculptors, photographers, architects, musicians, poets, film-makers, graphic and fashion designers, as well as through its revision in countless books and exhibitions. It might be said that, insofar as Cubism is still vital to us, it remains part of our visual language and power of self-expression. Insofar as Cubism belongs to art history, it has ceased to function in this way and has become something one can reflect on and make sense of from another historical position. The myriad legacies of Cubism thus comprise an important expression of the achievements and disappointments of modernism in the twentieth century.

      For Ballet Mecanique Léger abandoned narrative conventions and made a time-based collage of abstract shapes, fragments of real objects, prismatic shots, moving body parts and machinery. These are presented in contrasting temporal modes - from rapid-fire cuts to steady rhythm to slow revolutions. The whole is a hymn to the energies of the modern machine age, but articulated ... through the formal devices of film and with a strong emphasis on human perception and action.

        The artwork, while both humorous and controversial, relayed the message Cattelan had intended. It showed MoMA as a tourist destination and not an artwork gallery. Like many cultural destinations, MoMA focused on the commodification of art and promoted self-gratification right to its core. More, the work exposed how museums affiliate with emblematic aesthetics from individuals to branded merchandise.
      </p>
      <p>
        The performance also showed the influence of celebrity artists and how they influence art direction and history. The Picasso mascot on the museum entrance denoted how art content shifted from its ethos to a subject that lacked ideas in the mid-1990s era. The amusing face of the mascot reflected the unseriousness and degrading of art.

      <div class="igBox displayNone">
        <p>
          Robert Rauschenberg worked in a wide range of mediums including painting, sculpture, prints, photography, and performance, over the span of six decades. He emerged on the American art scene at the time that Abstract Expressionism was dominant, and through the course of his practice he challenged the gestural abstract painting and the model of the heroic, self-expressive artist championed by that movement.
        </p>
        <p>
          In his landmark series of Combines (1954–64) he mixed the materials of artmaking with ordinary things, writing, “I consider the text of a newspaper, the detail of photograph, the stitch in a baseball, and the filament in a light bulb as fundamental to the painting as brush stroke or enamel drip of paint.” In Bed (1955), for example, he covered a large wall-mounted board with a pillow and patchwork quilt which he then marked with graphite scrawls and exuberant lashings of paint, the latter perhaps an ironic nod to Abstract Expressionism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Born in Port Arthur, Texas, Rauschenberg studied at a variety of art schools including the experimental Black Mountain College outside of Asheville, North Carolina, where the artist and former Bauhaus instructor Josef Albers was his teacher. There, his mentors and collaborators included the composer John Cage, the artist Cy Twombly, and the choreographer Merce Cunningham, with whom he would collaborate on more than twenty dance compositions. Rauschenberg’s engagement with performance was enduring and a defining influence in his work. As his career began to gather steam in New York in the mid-1950s, he also began a crucial dialogue with the artist Jasper Johns that shaped the work of both: together the two artists pushed each other away from defined models of practice towards new modes that integrated the signs, images, and materials of the everyday world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Photography and printmaking were two of Rauschenberg’s abiding interests. In the 1958–60 series based on the thirty-four Cantos of Dante’s Inferno, he used a solvent to transfer photographs from contemporary magazines and newspapers onto drawing paper. The series is emblematic of a lifetime of experimentation with the ways the deluge of images in modern media culture could be transmitted and transformed.

        <p>
          Romare Bearden, in full Romare Howard Bearden, (born September 2, 1911, Charlotte, North Carolina, U.S.—died March 12, 1988, New York City, New York), American painter, whose collages of photographs and painted paper on canvas depict aspects of American black culture in a style derived from Cubism. He is considered one of the most important African American artists of the 20th century.
        </p>    
        <p>
          Bearden was born in North Carolina but grew up in New York City and Pittsburgh. He studied at the Art Students League in New York City with George Grosz (1936–37) and at Columbia University (1943). His early paintings were realistic and often religious in theme (e.g., The Annunciation, 1942). After military service during World War II, he lived in Paris (1950–51), studied at the Sorbonne, and traveled extensively in Europe. During this period he developed his mature, semiabstract collage style. He first achieved recognition in the mid-1940s, and by the 1960s he had come to be regarded as the preeminent collagist in the U.S.
        </p>
        <p>
          The narrative structure of Bearden’s paintings is simple and archetypal; ritual, music, and family are his pervasive themes. His works’ complexity lies in their poetic abstraction, in which layered fragments of colour and pattern evoke the rhythms, textures, and mysteries of a people’s experience (e.g., in Family, 1969).
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Bearden also was a songwriter and book illustrator, and he occasionally designed sets for the Alvin Ailey American Dance Company. In 1990 the Romare Bearden Foundation was established to promote his work and to support African American artists.

        Wangechi Mutu
      </h3>
      
      <button class="TFbutton">
        Bio
      </button>
      <div class="igBox displayNone">
        <p>
          Wangechi Mutu was born in 1972 in Nairobi, Kenya. In her collages, drawings, sculptures, and films, Mutu centers the female body to create powerful and self-possessed figures that are hybrids of human, plant, animal, and machine forms. Sampling from a diverse array of sources—from natural materials to fashion magazines, medical diagrams, and traditional African arts—the artist creates otherworldly realms that examine cultural identity, the feminine, colonial history, and global consumption.
        </p>
        <p>
          First recognized for her collage paintings, Mutu began her career combining ink and paint with fragments of images mined from fashion magazines, National Geographic, and vintage illustrations. With these materials, Mutu constructs elegant yet perverse female characters that subvert the ways in which Black and female bodies have been depicted, packaged, and consumed. The figures simultaneously embody the disjointed experience of navigating transnational identity, contemporary Africa, and Western preconceptions. Working extensively on nonabsorbent Mylar film, Mutu maneuvers colorful ink and paint on the surfaces of these works to build a fantastically dense and textured ground. In her varied sculpture practice, Mutu utilizes natural materials such as paper pulp and Kenyan soil while also working in monumental bronze. For her Sentinel series (2016–present), the artist creates regal and fierce abstract female forms made from clay, wood, and various found materials. Mutu describes these towering sculptures as guarding the very earth that they are made from; they serve as reminders of our relationship to the planet and harbingers of our environmental crisis. Mutu’s bronze works, such as The NewOnes, will free Us (2019) and MamaRay (2020), are supernatural humanoid figures that contest the traditional roles of women in art and propose alternative iconography and modes of representation as well as potential futures.

          Mutu received a BFA from Cooper Union for the Advancement of the Arts and Science and an MFA from Yale School of Art. She lives and works in New York and Nairobi.

        <p>
          Leonce Raphael Agbodjelou is one of the pre-eminent photographers of the Republic of Benin. Born in Porto-Novo in 1965, he was trained by his father, the world-renowned photographer Joseph Moise Agbodjelou (1912-2000). Leonce’s ongoing portraiture project, 'Citizens of Porto-Novo,' captures the people of Benin’s capital. Using a daylight studio and a medium format film, the artist interprets the experience of a generation caught between tradition and progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leonce is the founder and director of the first photographic school in Benin and has recently been appointed president of the Photographer's Association of Porto-Novo. His work has been exhibited at Saatchi Gallery London, Seattle Art Museum, Fowler Museum Los Angeles, Brooklyn Museum New York, Vitra Museum Basel, Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, Tel Aviv Museum of Art, Israel & Camden Arts Centre, London, among others.
