          Art Term: <em>Surrealism</em>
        </h4>
        <p>
          A twentieth-century literary, philosophical and artistic movement that explored the workings of the mind, championing the irrational, the poetic and the revolutionary. Refer to the <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/s/surrealism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tate's online glossary</a> for more.

      </div>
      
      <p>
        Nearly from its inception, Surrealism has had an international scope, but knowledge of the movement has been formed primarily through a Western European focus. Join Stephanie D&rsquo;Alessandro, the Leonard A. Lauder Curator of Modern Art and Senior Research Coordinator in the Department of Modern and Contemporary Art at The Met, and explore this exhibition, which reconsiders the true &ldquo;movement&rdquo; of Surrealism beyond boundaries of geography and chronology&mdash;and within networks that span Eastern Europe to the Caribbean, Asia to North Africa, and Australia to Latin America. Including examples from almost eight decades and produced across at least 45 countries, <em>Surrealism Beyond Borders</em> offers a fresh appraisal of some of the collective concerns and exchanges&mdash;as well as historical, national, and local distinctions&mdash;that will recast appreciation of this most revolutionary and globe-spanning movement.

        <h4>
          Reflections on the occasion of her birthday, 25th August
        </h4>
        <p>
          On the opening page of her first memoir, entitled <em>Birthday</em> (1986), American artist Dorothea Tanning tells us that &ldquo;the beginning is an impossible place.&rdquo; In doing this, she hoped to remind us of the complexity of storytelling, and the impossibility of attempting to distill the richness of lived experience into a single narrative or representation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her second memoir is entitled <em>Between Lives</em> (2001). Perhaps both titles allude to a way of understanding her intensely creative life. Her body of work spanned more than seventy years of ceaseless experimentation and included painting, drawing, print and etching, sculptures, fabric installation, etchings, jewellery, costume and set designs, collage, fiction and a considerable body of poetry.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Tanning, &ldquo;birthdays,&rdquo; as a mark of beginnings, were a metaphor for transformation. Accordingly, her characters are often caught in states of physical, emotional or psychological metamorphosis. Her work demonstrates a preoccupation with thresholds&mdash;liminal and transitional spaces in which fantasy, reality, sensation and imagination converge. From the outset, repeated motifs of doors, wallpaper and cloth are symbols of these thresholds that reveal otherworldly events folded into mundane, everyday spaces.

        <p>
          Dorothea Tanning, <em>Birthday</em>, 1942. Oil on canvas, 102.2 x 64.8 cm. Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <p>
        Tanning was born in 1910 in Galesburg, Illinois, a town in which she declared &ldquo;nothing ever happened but the wallpaper.&rdquo; Yet she spent a lifetime imagining what might be happening just under the surfaces of those neatly furnished sitting-rooms.
      </p>
      <p>
        A self-taught creator, she sustained herself as a successful commercial artist while pursuing her own painting. She was in New York as the surrealists began to arrive, exiled or rescued from a ravaged Europe, and she forged deep friendships with the likes of John Cage, Marcel Duchamp, Joseph Cornell and Lee Miller.
      </p>
      <p>
        While steeped in this artistic milieu and heavily influenced by surrealism, Tanning painted some of her best-known works. In <em>Birthday</em> (1942), the artist depicts herself in the process of metamorphosis, a &ldquo;rebirth&rdquo; from one state to another.
      </p>
      <p>
        She is strangely composed of hybrid parts, a fusion between reality and fantasy, mundane and magical, urban and rustic. The overall impression of the figure is of a chrysalis emerging from a cocoon. A fusion of both nature and culture, this dazzling young woman stands on the threshold of an unknown, yet exciting, adventure. The technical skill demonstrated in Birthday&mdash;its clarity and precision, typical of the surrealist style&mdash;intensifies the effect of the interwoven strands of fantasy and reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1999, the Philadelphia Museum of Art acquired Birthday. In the brochure for the survey show, entitled &ldquo;Birthday and Beyond,&rdquo; Tanning noted of the painting:
      </p>
      
      <blockquote><span></span><div>
        <p>
          It was a modest canvas by present-day standards. But it filled my New York studio, the apartment&rsquo;s back room, as if it had always been there. For one thing, it was the room; I had been struck, one day, by a fascinating array of doors&mdash;hall, kitchen, bathroom, studio&mdash;crowded together, soliciting my attention with their antic planes, light, shadows, imminent openings and shuttings. From there it was an easy leap to a dream of countless doors. Moreover, alone and taking stock of myself, I felt a sort of immanence as if my life was revealing itself at last&mdash;a real birthday.
        </p>
      </div></blockquote>
      
      
      <div class="dashedBox pad">
        <p>
          <strong>
            Sidenote:
          </strong>
          I was in Philadelphia a few months ago and saw a familiar face. I'd probably seen this painting online a hundred times in the previous months, and was still shocked at how much more I noticed IRL. Nothing beats looking at artworks in person!
