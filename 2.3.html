          In 1000, 1100, 1200, and 1300, China was the most advanced place in the world. Marco Polo (1254&ndash;1324) recognized this when he got to China in the late 13th century after traveling through much of Asia. In what is now Europe, this was the period now referred to as the &ldquo;high&rdquo; Middle Ages, which fostered the Crusades and witnessed the rise of Venice, the mercantile center that was Marco Polo&rsquo;s home.
        </p>
        <p>
          For several centuries the Chinese economy had grown spectacularly: "Between &hellip; 960 and &hellip; 1127, China passed through a phase of economic growth that was unprecedented in earlier Chinese history, perhaps in world history up to this time. It depended on a combination of commercialization, urbanization, and industrialization that has led some authorities to compare this period in Chinese history with the development of early modern Europe six centuries later."<button class="footnote" id="f1">1</button> <cite class="em" style="display: inline;"> (tip: click on these buttons to see footnotes) </cite>

        <ul class="list">
          <li>
            During the Song Dynasty (960&ndash;1276), technology was highly advanced in fields as diverse as agriculture, iron-working, and printing. Indeed, scholars today talk of a Song economic revolution.
          </li>
          <li>
            The population grew rapidly during this time&mdash;from approximately 50 million in 742 to 100 million by 1100&mdash;and more and more people lived in cities.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Song system of government was also advanced for its time. The upper-levels of the government were staffed by highly educated scholar-officials selected through competitive written examinations.

        <h4>
          Why else is the Song Dynasty so significant?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Many ways of living and acting that are now seen as most &ldquo;Chinese,&rdquo; or even characteristically East Asian, did not appear before the Song.
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>
            <strong>Rice</strong> and <strong>tea</strong> are historically important crops/staple foods in China; but most Chinese during the previous Tang dynasty and before ate wheat and millet and drank wine. Rice and tea became dominant food and drink in the Song.
          </li>
          <li>
            China&rsquo;s <strong>population</strong> is large, and tends to &ldquo;explode&rdquo; in certain periods; its first explosion occurred in the Song.
          </li>
          <li>
            Many Chinese are &ldquo;Confucians&rdquo;; but the kind of <strong>Confucianism</strong> that served as government orthodoxy throughout late-imperial times was a Song reinvention.
          </li>
          <li>
            Chinese <strong>women</strong> are known to have bound their feet; but they did not bind them until the Song.
          </li>
          <li>
            Even the <strong>&ldquo;Chinese&rdquo; roof</strong> with its turned-up corners is by origin a Song Chinese roof.
            <button class="footnote" id="f2">2</button>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Yet, despite its political and economic strengths, Song China was not able to dominate its neighbors militarily. Central to its engagement with the outside world were efforts to maintain peace with its powerful northern neighbors (Liao, Jin, Xi Xia, and the Mongols) and extend its trading networks (the Silk Road and the port of Quanzhou).

    "what" : `
    <h4>What is the title of the <em>Qingming</em> scroll?</h4>
    <p>
      The full title of the scroll is <em>Qingming Shanghe Tu</em> (清明上河圖). Its exact meaning is not clear, and has been a subject of some debate among modern scholars of the scroll. The second half of the title, i.e., "Shanghe Tu," meaning "going-along-the-river picture," is relatively unproblematic; most scholars agree that it refers to the river that runs through the entire scroll. The first term, however, "Qingming" is much more ambiguous. It literally means "clear-bright," i.e., "peaceful and orderly," but it is also the name of a popular grave-sweeping festival on the one-hundredth day after the winter solstice, sometime in April. Much of the debate over the title is focused on whether the term "Qingming" refers to the festival or not, and by extension, whether the artist Zhang Zeduan meant to depict a scene from the Qingming festival or simply a peaceful, orderly, and prosperous scene along the river. It has, therefore, been variously translated as <em>The Spring Festival Along the River</em> or <em>Peace Reigns Over the River</em>.
    </p>
    `,
    "who" : `
    <h4>Who is the artist of the <em>Qingming</em> scroll?</h4>
    <p>
      The <em>Qingming</em> scroll has traditionally been attributed to a certain Zhang Zeduan (張擇端) (fl. 12th-century). There is basically no trace of him at all in the historical records from his time, and what little information we have of him now is exclusively from the colophons to the scroll by later writers, the earliest of which is dated to the year 1186. This earliest, and arguably most informative, colophon reads as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hanlin Zhang Zeduan, styled Zhengdao, is a native of Dongwu [now Zhucheng, Shandong]. When young, he studied and traveled to the capital for further study. Later he practiced painting things. He showed talent for ruled-line painting, and especially liked boats and carts, markets and bridges, moats and paths. He was an expert in other types of paintings as well. According to <em>A Record of Mr Xiang's Views on Paintings<em>, <em>Regatta on the Western Lake</em> (Xihu zhengbiao tu) and <em>Peace Reigns Over the River</em> (Qingming shanghe tu) are placed in the category of inspired paintings. The owner should treasure it. On the day after the Qingming festival, in 1186, Zhang Zhu from Yanshan wrote this colophon."</em></em>
    </p>

    "how" : `
    <h4>
      How did the artist paint the <em>Qingming</em> scroll?
    </h4>
    <p>
      Though little is known about Zhang, he is thought to have been close to the imperial court in some way and may have been commissioned by the emperor to create this work in the 12th century. Artists during this period often used the &ldquo;ruled-line&rdquo; painting technique to capture the man-made structures that define urban city life in incredibly realistic detail (the technique is not used on figures, but it is often used in figure paintings to portray the palaces, boats, bridges, garden architecture, etc.). The technique, jiehua 界畫, which alternatively could be translated as &ldquo;boundary painting,&rdquo; involved two elements: a ruler or compass and a line-brush, which were used together to create straight lines. The line-brush would be guided alongside the ruler to create straight lines of unvarying widths useful for depicting the architecture of palaces, gardens, and other man-made objects such as boats and chariots. It was initially looked down upon as a technique that stifled expression by so rigidly controlling the brush (in contrast with the expressive potential of calligraphy and ink painting), but it soon grew popular as a mode for depicting architecture and its wooden constructions with incredible precision and accuracy. This aesthetic was especially popular during the Song dynasty, a time when specific regulations applied to nearly every aspect of the visual world. Since the ruled-line technique could be used for any object that required attention to careful measurements and rules, artists soon began to use the technique for picturing everything from the inner workings of grain mills to palace festivities.
    </p>
    `,
    "where" : `
    <h4>Where are the scenes from the <em>Qingming</em> scroll based?</h4>

      There is no definite answer to this question. Much of the scholarship presupposes that the city depicted in the scroll is the Northern Song capital of Kaifeng 開封. The river in the scroll would therefore be the famous Bian River 汴河, one of the major canals running through Kaifeng during the Northern Song dynasty (960&ndash;1127). Efforts have been made to identify various structures depicted in the scroll, such as the Rainbow Bridge or the various wine shops, as those mentioned in the historical records on the city of Kaifeng during the Northern Song.

      However, some scholars, such as Valerie Hansen of Yale University (the historian from the video above), have argued that the Qingming scroll is in fact a depiction of an idealized city, with no particular reference to the Kaifeng or any specific city in the Northern Song for that matter. Her argument is that virtually every single detail in scroll is depicted in an extremely generic way, despite the tremendous amount of realistic details, and no obvious landmarks of Kaifeng that we know of from historical sources can be clearly identified in the scroll. In fact, Hansen found that the scroll contains not a single apparent historical landmark at all. She argues that it is a painting of an ideal city, evoking with nostalgia perhaps the prosperity of the new urban space in Northern Song times. Regardless of whether the city is real or imaginary, all scholars would agree, however, that the scroll has a tremendous amount of realistic details pertaining to the new urban space that arose in the Northern Song.

    "why" : `
    <h4>Why is the <em>Qingming</em> scroll considered a "monument"?</h4>
    <p>
      The <em>Qingming</em> scroll measures 24.8 cm in height and 528.7 cm in width. It was done in monochrome ink on silk, and considering that it is already more than 800 years old, it is in surprisingly good condition. Most of the original details are intact, and there are only a few patches and blemishes throughout the scroll. The original is now housed at the National Palace Museum in Beijing, China. Part of the allure (and monumentality) of <em>Along the River</em> stems from its dramatic history. The painting was repeatedly stolen over time, and finally taken by the last emperor Puyi, the puppet ruler of the Japanese state of Manchukuo.

      Copied as early as the 14th century, several versions of this handscroll exist today. Art historians believe that the one in Beijing is the original 12th-century work due to careful analysis of its style, materials (ink painting on the medium of silk), and seals that document its provenance. Copies and reproductions function as studies for later artists and as a method for preserving significant works. However, artists often updated the original, using features and styles specific to contemporary tastes.

      A copy from the 18th century (below), the collaboration of several Qing dynasty court artists, depicts customs of the Ming and Qing dynasties. With many more figures attired in fashions of their time, and with abundant use of pastel hues on an even larger composition, there appears to be less of a focus on the lifestyle and economy of the Song capital than of the worldly tastes of the Qing dynasty (1644&ndash;1912). In the Qing version, elaborate ornamentation, well-dressed palace figures, and vibrant colors overshadow the common figures and detailed cityscape that characterize the earlier version. Concluding the 37-foot handscroll, the Qing artists characterized the final section with elaborate palace gardens and architecture&mdash;an element not present in the earlier handscroll attributed to Zhang. In this way, copies can build on the original concept&mdash;to portray the flourishing economy and sophisticated urban life of the Song dynasty, for instance&mdash;and translate it into the visual terms of the present.
