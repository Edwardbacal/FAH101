        Amiable Protest and Africouture

        "In a way, when people see an artist of African origin, they think: oh, he is here to protest. Yes, okay. I am here to protest, but I am going to do it like a gentleman. It is going to look very nice. You are not even going to realize that I am protesting, you are going to invite me to your museum because the work is nice, and then when I am inside, it is too late. But I have to do it nicely&mdash;because if I am already coming to you with a knife, you're going to send me away."

      <p>
        Yinka Shonibare CBE was born in London and raised in Nigeria. He studied art at Goldsmiths College in London and today is one of the most widely known and successful Afro-British artists. In 2019, he was given the title Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire and has since added the acronym CBE to his official name. Well-versed in postcolonial cultural theory, Shonibare sees himself as a "postcolonial hybrid" who practices the genteel restraint of a British gentleman and has gained access to the most prestigious museums of the Western world with his exquisitely tailored parodies of the lifestyle of the British upper classes. Shonibare's amiable and stylistically consummate subversion consists in his signature use of double-sided, colourfully printed cotton fabrics to invade the art and museum worlds. Seen as typically African, the fabrics are a telling example of global colonial entanglements; known as Dutch wax, the fabrics were originally created in an attempt to imitate the patterns of the elaborately handcrafted Indonesian batik fabrics and produce them on an industrial scale in a textile printing process.

      <h4>
        Art Term: Postcolonial Art
      </h4>
      <p>
        Postcolonial art refers to art produced in response to the aftermath of colonial rule, frequently addressing issues of national and cultural identity, race and ethnicity. Refer to the <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/p/postcolonial-art" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tate's online glossary</a> for more.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        However, the new mass product failed to be successful in the Dutch colony and, in the nineteenth century, found its way to West Africa, where a market for the printed cotton fabrics developed. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the fabrics came to be designed and produced mainly in the Netherlands and England, while Africa became the largest market for them. Today, much of the production takes place in Africa and China; only the most expensive fabrics are made in Holland. The Dutch town of Helmond near Eindhoven is where Vlisco's exquisite patterns are created, which are then used to tailor "Africouture" clothing in West Africa. And this is also where Shonibare obtains the fabrics for his postcolonial role plays and ironic deconstructions of Victorian traditions and customs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The hybrid history of the wax prints and their multifarious symbolic appropriation as an expression of supposed authenticity, fashionable individuality and cultural belonging reveal the ambivalent and asymmetric relationship between colonial power and colonized, which persists to the present day. Shonibare's subversive strategy, meanwhile, consists in harnessing the colonial past and postcolonial present of his industrially manufactured material to create works which visually seduce the viewer, while at the same time revealing themselves as self-reflective constructs. His work relies on theatricality and employs visual alienating effects which comment on and, in doing so, subvert the beautiful or historical illusion. Similar to the concept of metafiction used in postmodern literary theory, he seeks to critically examine the relationship of art and life by means of parody? When dressing headless figures in Victorian fashion, bedecking interiors with pseudo-African fabrics or staging himself in a period series as an admired black dandy of the Victorian Empire, he always occupies a dual position which, incapable of being assimilated or exoticized, instead explores the third space where cultures meet and mix. The objective of Shonibare's playful visual grammar is to show hybridity, while at the same time consistently frustrating any desire for authenticity in the sense of a longing for immediacy, originality, genuineness and purity.
