            Edward is a learning designer and occasional art historian. He did his BA and PhD at U of T, plus an MA at University College London. He specializes in modern and contemporary art and especially likes abstract and conceptual art from the last 60 years, as well as theory that is impossible to understand yet transforms how you think. Since finishing his PhD, he’s been working in digital design and media and has a day job at CAMH producing an online education project. He teaches art history when he has the chance. He thinks the best way to learn about art is to visit as many galleries in as many places as you can.

            In Week 1, we are going to build and develop your note-taking skills and help you select an art object that you will examine for the remainder of the semester. Before we jump into the specifics, let’s start with the big question: What is art history?
          </p>
          <p>
            As the term “art history” implies, this interpretive enterprise combines two distinct but ultimately interrelated aspects: the study of individual works of art outside time and place (formal analysis and certain types of critical theory) and the historical study of art as a product of its broad cultural context (iconography and contextualism). The scope of art history is immense, commensurate with the many and varied ways human beings have represented their world and expressed their ideas and ideals in visual form.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this course, we will consider the various methods, studies, and concerns relating to the discipline of art history. What is the role of connoisseurship and technical art history in the analyses of art objects? How does social history and material culture interact with the work of art historians, anthropologists, and archaeologists? What is our role in the preservation and documentation of art? What is art? 
          </p>
          <p>
            I look forward to hearing your thoughts on many of these questions in the coming weeks. Remember to take notes following the advice outlined in this module and start exploring art collections so that you may select an object to write about and present on this semester. Have fun!  
          </p>

      <h3>
        What do art historians do?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Art historians do art. But we don't make it; we study it. We try to understand what artists express in their work and what viewers perceive. We try to understand why something was made at the time it was made, how it reflected the world it was made in, and how it affected that world. We talk about individual artists and their goals and intentions, but also about patrons (the people who commission artworks), viewers, and the kinds of institutions, places, and social groups in which art is made and circulates – whether that's an art school, temple, or government agency.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words, we look closely at artworks, but we also look at everything around them, which affects how they are made and perceived.

            Historical Background and Contextual Information
          </h4>
          
          <p>
            Historical background and contextual information are the "history" of art history. Historical information is used to elucidate works of art. In history classes, images are shown to illustrate a historical event or period. Art is used as "wallpaper." In art history classes, the relationship is different. Historical circumstances (or historical contexts) are used to show how history can shape a work of art and often help explain changes in works of different periods. Write down the historical information so that you can comprehend the full meaning of the art objects.

            The Visual Information
          </h4>
          
          <p>
            While the historical component is important, you may notice instructors spending a lot of time describing and analyzing images. In art history classes, instructors will engage with the artwork, describe their visual properties, explore the messages they send, and compare them with other art objects. This is the essence of art history, and you will be doing the same in tests, papers, and discussions. Engaging with works of art is one of the most significant challenges for art history students. Practice this skill early and often. How will instructors discuss a work of art? Below are some key groupings to help you organize the visual information.

            The "Vital Statistics" of an Image
          </h4>
          
          <p>
            The vital statistics of an artwork include its name, when it was produced, who produced it, and where it is located. Most of this information can be gathered from the museum label. Some clarification on chronology:
          </p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              With years in the AD or CE, the larger the number, the more recent the time. For example, 1900 CE is more recent than 500 CE.
            </li>
            <li>
              In BC or BCE years, the opposite is true. The larger the number, the earlier the time. For example, 500 BCE is more recent than 800 BCE, which is more recent than 1300 BCE.
            </li>
            <li>
              The year 1923 is not in the nineteenth century, it is in the twentieth century. If you are given a date by century, such as the fifth century CE, remember that to find the date in years, you should subtract one from five. Hence, a date in the fifth century CE will be in the 400s. This rule works for both centuries in BCE and CE. For example, a work dated to the third century BCE could date anywhere from 200&ndash;299 BCE.
            </li>    
          </ul>

            <li>
              The first half of the second century = 100&ndash;150 CE. The second quarter of the nineteenth century = 1825&ndash;1850. The middle of the seventh century BCE = 650 BCE.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you are given a date with no BCE (BC) or CE (AD) attached, generally, you can assume it is in CE (AD), just as we tend to say 2020 rather than 2020 CE.
            </li>
            <li>
              Contemporary is commonly understood to mean "current"; however, it can also mean "at the same time as." For example, if you are asked to look at a painting by Renoir and read a "contemporary text," you are being asked to read a text written in the late nineteenth century, when Renoir was active.

            The Content of an Image
          </h4>
          
          <p>
            There is much more to an image than its vital statistics. The content of an image refers to several levels and types of meaning expressed through the literal content and metaphorical content of the art object. This is where we delve into the 5Ws and 1H of art history (discussed above).

            The Visual Description of an Image
          </h4>
          
          <p>
            Describing the visual properties of a work of art can be challenging. Why should we describe an image when we are sitting here looking at it? The answer is because there is looking and then there is <em>looking</em>. One of the most important skills you can learn in art history is how to look at an image actively and critically. When looking at images passively, we revert to descriptive adjectives&mdash;It is beautiful. But when we are actively looking, we can offer more specific information: the elongated proportions of the figure, the handling of different textures such as flesh and silk, etc. In describing images, art terms are often used. For example: The figure stands in a <em>contrapposto</em> stance, with the weight of the body shifted onto the left leg. The <em>wet drapery</em> sticks to the figure's body, revealing the cavity of the navel as well as an expanse of thigh. The description provides information about the position of the body and the quality of the drapery. More importantly, special attention has been devoted to how the drapery reveals the body underneath.

            The Formal Analysis
          </h4>
          
          <p>
            The next component of visual information you need to identify is formal analysis. We have described what is happening in the image: what the figure is doing, how it is standing, and its specific physical properties. That is all well and good. But what do all these properties add up to? What is their total effect? Formal analysis studies how a work of art comes together to create a specific effect. The critical element here is that the discussion has turned from objective, matter-of-fact statements about the form to consider how the form creates abstract patterns that shape the overall effect of the work and our reaction to it.

            The Macrostatement and the Comparison
          </h4>
          <p>
            Macrostatements provide specific examples of what makes a work of art typical of its period. If you understand the basic characteristics of each period, you will be able to speak intelligently not only about works you are familiar with, but also about works you have never seen. Comparisons are often used in macrostatements because they are instructive&mdash;showing you how a period can be defined by contrasting it with another. They illustrate what is important about each style&mdash;what visual properties are typical. They give you a sense of the <em>evolution of forms</em>.

        Taking notes in Art History
      </h3>
      
      <p>
        How do you record all this information in a useful way? During lectures, it is helpful to organize information by slides. As soon as a slide is shown, identify it with a star or some type of graphic device. Most instructors will provide the vital statistics directly on the slide. Listen to the lecture and identify what type of information is being given. Is the instructor talking about historical background? If so, write "HB" and then note, in abbreviated form, what is said. If the instructor starts with a visual description and formal analysis, again, write down keywords and phrases. For example, consider these notes for the images below:

          Record your impressions
        </h4>
        <p>
          Record your initial impressions of the object while they are still fresh in your mind. I recommend sketching the object (from various angles and highlighting different details) and adding annotations. Concentrate on what feelings or ideas the work elicited. Try to be honest, vivid, and original in writing your thoughts. Avoid overt statements of judgment such as "the women in the picture are so pretty" or "the baby is adorable." Do not only write that a work is "beautiful" or "glorious." Even if you find it so, you need to delve deeper into your own reactions and come up with more specific terms: is it serene? graceful? luminous? cheerful?
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, write down the work's "vital statistics": its title, artist (if known), date, material, size, and location. If mentioned in the caption, you might also want to note down its place of origin. Having recorded the vital statistics of the work and your initial impressions, it is time to note your visual observations, a process often called "prewriting." As the name suggests, this is a preliminary stage to writing the paper. Don't worry about elegant language or even complete sentences. Don't worry about drafting some poetic metaphor for the work in front of you. Just focus on being as thorough, clear, and precise as possible. Why? Because these notes will provide you with "research material"&mdash;the notes from which you will compose your paper.

          The next step is for you to analyze the <em>formal</em> (or visual) aspects of your work of art using the language of art history. We will explore how to accomplish this in Weeks 3, 4, and 5. In the meantime, have fun exploring the objects. Once you have settled on the art object you wish to write about this semester, sketch your chosen object and include annotations of your observations. We will examine an example of a sketch with annotations during tutorials in Week 2.

            Throughout this course, we will attempt to think critically about art. Let’s explore seven ideas that will guide us in the coming weeks.
          </p> 
          <p>
            <strong>
              One. Identify the artist’s decisions and choices and question why those 
            </strong>
            decisions and choices were made. Begin by recognizing that, in making works of art, artists inevitably make certain decisions and choices. Identify these choices. Then ask yourself why these choices were made. Remember, although artists could be working somewhat intuitively, every artist has the opportunity to revise or redo each work, each gesture. You can be sure that what you are seeing in a work of art is an intentional effect. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              Two. Ask more questions. Be curious. 
            </strong>
            Asking yourself why the artist’s choices were made is just the first set of questions to pose. You need to consider the work’s title: What does it tell you about the piece? Is there any written material accompanying the work? Is the work informed by the context in which you encounter it or by other works around it, or, in the case of sculpture for instance, by its location? Is there anything you learn about the artist that is helpful? 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              Three. Describe the object. 
            </strong>
            By carefully describing the object—both its subject matter and how its subject matter is formally realized—you can discover much about the artist’s intentions. Pay careful attention on how one part of the work relates to the others. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              Four. Question your assumptions. 
            </strong>
            Question your own initial assumptions and examine the work itself to see if it contains any biases or prejudices. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              Five. Avoid an emotional response. 
            </strong>
            Art objects can stir up feelings, but your emotions can sometimes get in the way of clear thinking. Analyze your own emotions. Determine what about the work set them off, and ask yourself if this wasn’t the artist’s very intention. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              Six. Don’t oversimplify or misrepresent the art object. 
            </strong>
            Art objects are complex by their nature. To think critically about an art object is to look beyond the obvious. Thinking critically about the work of art always involves walking the line between the work’s susceptibility to interpretation and its integrity, or its resistance to arbitrary and capricious readings. Be sure your reading of a work of art is complete enough (that it recognizes the full range of possible meanings the work might possess), and, at the same time, that it doesn’t violate or misinterpret the work. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              Lastly, seven. Tolerate uncertainty. 
            </strong>
            Remember that critical thinking is an exercise in discovery, that it is designed to uncover possibilities, not necessarily certain truths. It is a process of questioning: asking good questions is sometimes more important than arriving at “right” answers. There may, in fact, be no “right” answers.

      "name" : `
      <h4>
        Artist’s name
      </h4>
      <p>
        A caption usually gives you the artist’s name first. If the artist’s (or architect’s) name isn’t known, then it may say something like “artist unknown” or list nothing at all. An expression like “After Polykleitos” means that the work is a copy by an unknown artist of an original by a known artist, in this case the ancient Greek sculptor Polykleitos. An expression like “Circle of Rembrandt” or “School of Rembrandt” indicates an unknown artist who is thought to have worked closely with, or been a student of, a known artist.
      </p>
      `,
      "title" : `
      <h4>
        Title
      </h4>
      <p>
        The title of the work usually follows the artist’s name. Sometimes a work is titled by the artist, as in sculptor Audrey Flack’s (b. 1931) Marilyn (Vanitas). Sometimes the title is a descriptive one that the artist didn’t give to the work but that is used as a convenient way to refer to it, for example the Arnolfini Portrait. The practice of giving titles to artworks hasn’t been used in all time periods and cultures, so many are named in this way. Sometimes a title refers to a patron or collector—for example, Velázquez’s painting Venus and Cupid is also known as the Rokeby Venus after a famous collector who once owned it. In English-language titles, the first word and other main words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) usually start with a capital letter, while conjunctions (such as and) and prepositions (such as by, from) are lowercase. In other languages there are different conventions.
      </p>
      `,
      "date" : `
      <h4>
        Date
      </h4>
      <p>
        The date for a work may be precise, as when it’s signed and dated by the artist, or it may be an approximate date determined by scholars. In this case, a range may be given (for example, “460–450 BCE” or “9th–10th century CE”) or the Latin word circa (“around”) may be used (circa is often abbreviated as “c.”). BC means “before Christ” and is equivalent to BCE, “before the common era.” AD means anno domini (“in the year of our Lord,” or after the birth of Christ). It is equivalent to CE, or “common era.”
      </p>
      `,
      "medium" : `
      <h4>
        Medium
      </h4>
      <p>
        A caption will usually also list the materials used in the work because photographs often cannot give a truly accurate impression of what materials make up a work.
      </p>
      `,
      "provenance" : `
      <h4>
        Collection and location
      </h4>
      <p>
        This tells you where the work is now. It is often the name and location of a museum or gallery, or the name of the collection that owns the work but that may not necessarily display it in public (such as the Government Art Collection in Britain). Where the work belongs to a private collector, the location may simply be given as “Private Collection.”
