            Monuments of Art History examines key works of art and architecture from antiquity to the present and from across the globe, with emphasis on the cultural roles art has played throughout history. This broad selection of artworks corresponds to subject areas taught by U of T’s Art History faculty, offering a preview of many 200-400 level courses you can take through the Department of Art History.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will pay special attention to developing foundational art historical skills, including the ability to observe, analyze, compare, and write about works of art and architecture. Tutorials will provide training in, and practice applying, the basic principles and vocabulary of art historical scholarship. Assignments are based on these skills and draw on course modules, tutorials, readings, and visits to local museums. 
          </p>
          <p>
            No previous knowledge of art or architecture is required.

          <p>
            In place of lectures, this course features online modules (lessons made up of short videos, texts, and images) which explore art objects and develop art historical skills. Two modules will be posted on Quercus each Monday. You can work through them on your own time but should aim to complete them before that week’s tutorial.

            Summary
          </h3>
          <p>
            This is the first of two assignments in which you will engage with one art object, chosen from the options provided below. It consists of two parts: a sketch with annotations and a written analysis.
          </p>
          <p>
            To start, select the object you feel most compelled to analyze and visit it in person. While there, create a sketch that, to the best of your abilities, depicts the object as it impresses you.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong>
            You will not be graded on the artistic quality of the sketch. The sketch can look terrible and you can still get an A+, what matters is how you demonstrate close engagement with the object through the way you record your visual observations on the page.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Next, you will write a 600-700 word formal analysis of your chosen artwork. Here you will take what you noted in making your sketch and translate your observations into a cohesive essay, applying the skills you will learn in Module 3 and practice in tutorials.
          </p>
          
          <h3>
            Objectives
          </h3>
          
          <h5>
            The sketch is meant for you to practice close engagement with art by doing the following:
          </h5>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              Slow-looking and mindful noticing: spending time with an artwork and thinking about how it strikes you (how do you take in the full work, what parts stand out, how do the details present themselves to you, etc).
            </li>
            <li>
              Recording your visual impressions by translating them into a sketch
            </li>
            <li>
              Annotating your sketch with brief notes describing what you've seen and how you've chosen to represented them. 
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <h5>
            The formal analysis asks you to demonstrate the following skills: 
          </h5>
          
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              Describing, analyzing, and formulating a thesis about an artwork.
            </li>
            <li>
              Translating visual observations and interpretations into written statements; organizing your thoughts into an essay.
            </li>
            <li>
              Posing interpretive questions about art using the Who? / What? / When? / Where? / Why? / How? format.
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            Looking ahead, this essay will prepare you for assignment 2: by preparing you to identify the ways one artwork is visually constructed, you will be ready to discuss how those qualities connect and/or distinguish multiple artworks seen together.
          </p>

            Things to consider
          </h3>
          <h5>
            For the sketch:
          </h5>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              If the object is three-dimensional, is there a best angle to view it from? Or does it need to be portrayed from multiple angles?

            This assignment asks you to create a diagrammatic timeline that details a historical period relevant to Cubism – not the history of Cubism itself but a chosen path (or paths) that runs through it. In addition to outlining the period's historical details (relevant events, individuals, artworks, institutions, texts, etc.) your timeline should make a larger art historical argument with its own thesis. Consider what you say about art through the way you present it — through what you choose to include and exclude and how you connect the dots.
          </p>
          <p>
            This timeline is no point-form list. At the least, you should generously illustrate it with visual examples and textual citations; more importantly, it's an opportunity to creatively engage with art history using different media. There is no precribed way to to make this timeline, it can be a PDF, a poster, a slide-show, a story, a website, a video, an audio-installation, a mural, a performance... I encourage you to experiment and have fun with it. You won't be graded on your creative skills, but you should be deliberate about your timeline's form, format, and media, and how those things shape your message.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to the timeline itself, you will have to provide a supporting statement (500-700 words) to explain the following:
          </p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              The specific history your timeline documents and why you chose it.
            </li>
            <li>
              What this timeline teaches us about the period it details - what art historical thesis does it arrive at?
            </li>
            <li>
              What motivated your choice of details to include (or not include) and your choice of medium/format.

            The exam will be 2 hours long, but will be designed to take roughly 90-110 minutes to complete.
          </p>
          <p>
            The exam has not yet been written, but will likely consist of essay questions: one short, one medium, and one long. You will be able to choose from a selection of questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Questions will focus on broad themes and ideas explored throughout the course. You will be expected to speak to these ideas about art in relation to specific examples from the course. This exam will not emphasis memorization or providing objective answers.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will be allowed to bring in a study-sheet: this is one (and only one) page (8.5" x 11" or similar), which you can fill with handwritten notes (no print-outs). Pro-tip, making this sheet is a great way to study. No other aids are allowed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The exam has not been scheduled yet. The faculty of arts and sciences schedule all exams, and I don't have any say on when and where it will take place. I just know it's during the exam period (August ).
          </p>
          <p>
            It's worth 35% of your final grade (The Faculty of Arts and Sciences requires first year courses have exams that are worth at least 1/3 of your grade).

            Why do we have an in-person exam?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Having an exam is an useful opportunity to reflect on the range of content and ideas explored throughout the course. While in-person exams are an imperfect way of evaluating learning, and not a format that's optimal for everyone, I've tried to adapt it so that people who need more time or may benefit from notes can complete it to the best of their abilities. More to the point, the reality is that it's currently essential to have an AI-proof evaluation where you practice writing in your own voice. I know that many people may be English language learners or not be strong writers, but I'm not looking for polished essay-style responses, so much as evidence of you communicating your own original thoughts about the course content.
          </p>

            If you have a conflict (e.g. another exam at the same time) you can report it to the faculty registrar. More information is <a href="https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/faculty-registrar/final-exams/exam-conflicts" target="_blank">here</a>.
