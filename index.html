            Modules
          </h4>
          <p>
            In place of lectures, this course features online modules (lessons made up of short videos, texts, and images) which explore art objects and develop your art historical skills. A group of modules will be posted on the course site each Monday. You can work through them on your own time but should aim to complete them before that week’s tutorial.
          </p>
          <h4>
            Tutorials
          </h4>
          <p>
            Tutorials are a mandatory part of this course and occur each week. There, you will discuss course content, practice key art historical skills, and collaborate on activities with classmates. Attendance and completion of activities make up 15% of your final grade.
          </p>

            Monuments of Art History examines key works of art and architecture from antiquity to the present and from across the globe, with emphasis on the cultural roles art has played throughout history. This broad selection of artworks corresponds to subject areas taught by U of T’s Art History faculty, offering a preview of many 200-400 level courses you can take through the Department of Art History.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will pay special attention to developing foundational art historical skills, including the ability to observe, analyze, compare, and write about works of art and architecture. Tutorials will provide training in, and practice applying, the basic principles and vocabulary of art historical scholarship. Assignments are based on these skills and draw on course modules, tutorials, readings, and visits to local museums. 
          </p>
          <p>
            No previous knowledge of art or architecture is required.

            Summary
          </h4>
          <p>
            This is the first of two assignments in which you will engage with one art object, chosen from the options provided below. It consists of two parts: a sketch with annotations and a written analysis.
          </p>
          <p>
            To start, select the object you feel most compelled to analyze and visit it in person. While there, create a sketch that, to the best of your abilities, depicts the object as it impresses you.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong>
            You will not be graded on the artistic quality of the sketch. The sketch can look terrible and you can still get an A+, what matters is how you demonstrate close engagement with the object through the way you record your visual observations on the page.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Next, you will write a 600-700 word formal analysis of your chosen artwork. Here you will take what you noted in making your sketch and translate your observations into a cohesive essay, applying the skills you will learn in Module 3 and practice in tutorials.
          </p>
          
          <h4>
            Objectives
          </h4>
          
          <h5>
            The sketch is meant for you to practice close engagement with art by doing the following:
          </h5>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              Slow-looking and mindful noticing: spending time with an artwork and thinking about how it strikes you (how do you take in the full work, what parts stand out, how do the details present themselves to you, etc).
            </li>
            <li>
              Recording your visual impressions by translating them into a sketch
            </li>
            <li>
              Annotating your sketch with brief notes describing what you've seen and how you've chosen to represented them. 
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <h5>
            The formal analysis asks you to demonstrate the following skills: 
          </h5>
          
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              Describing, analyzing, and formulating a thesis about an artwork.
            </li>
            <li>
              Translating visual observations and interpretations into written statements; organizing your thoughts into an essay.
            </li>
            <li>
              Posing interpretive questions about art using the Who? / What? / When? / Where? / Why? / How? format.
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            Looking ahead, this essay will prepare you for assignment 2: by preparing you to identify the ways one artwork is visually constructed, you will be ready to discuss how those qualities connect and/or distinguish multiple artworks seen together.
          </p>

            Things to consider
          </h4>
          <h5>
            For the sketch:
          </h5>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              If the object is three-dimensional, is there a best angle to view it from? Or does it need to be portrayed from multiple angles?
            </li>
            <li>
              If certain elements jump out at you, consider providing sketches of those details and parts.
            </li>
            <li>
              The hand can notice things the eyes miss - pay attention to what you notice in the act of sketching.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h5>
            For the formal analysis:
          </h5>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              Is the thesis clear? Is it specific and direct
            </li>
            <li>
              Have you used proper formatting, including standard format for listing titles of artworks (see the museum label example in section 1.3)
            </li>
            <li>
              Additional images are not required, however, if you include photos of the artwork please caption them. 
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>
            Additional instructions
          </h4>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              Write on only one work from the options listed below 
            </li>
            <li>
              Sketches can be created physically on paper or digitally in a drawing/painting app. The sketch is to be created from scratch by you and cannot be compiled from digital graphics or photographs. Annotations should engage with the sketch directly and can be handwritten or typed.
            </li>
            <li>
              No research is involved - please focus on the visual qualities of the object.
            </li>
            <li>
              We'll discuss the assignment in tutorials and in the course, with examples.

          <p>
            This assignment builds on your sketch and formal analysis by comparing your chosen artwork (the same one from assignment 1) with one of the "monuments" from class (options are listed below) in order to analyze and interpret the differences/similarities between them. Whereas assignment 1 asked you to visually examine one art object in isolation, this assignment asks you to re-examine that work in relation to another, and to offer explanations—backed by references—that substantiate your observations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like in your formal analysis, you will have to include a thesis statement that distills the key claims of your analysis. Here, you will also have to cite 2 or more scholarly sources to support your claims (more on citations below).
          </p>
          <p>
            Word count: 900-1100 words (including citations and bibliography).

              2 bonus marks if you use physical periodicals or books for your citations. You can find these at the library!

            The exam will be 2 hours long, but will be designed to take roughly 90-110 minutes to complete.
          </p>
          <p>
            The exam has not yet been written, but will likely consist of essay questions: one short, one medium, and one long. You will be able to choose from a selection of questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Questions will focus on broad themes and ideas explored throughout the course. You will be expected to speak to these ideas about art in relation to specific examples from the course. This exam will not emphasis memorization or providing objective answers.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will be allowed to bring in a study-sheet: this is one (and only one) page (8.5" x 11" or similar), which you can fill with handwritten notes (no print-outs). Pro-tip, making this sheet is a great way to study. No other aids are allowed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The exam has not been scheduled yet. The faculty of arts and sciences schedule all exams, and I don't have any say on when and where it will take place. I just know it's during the exam period (August 15-30).
          </p>
          <p>
            It's worth 35% of your final grade (The Faculty of Arts and Sciences requires first year courses have exams that are worth at least 1/3 of your grade).

            Why do we have an in-person exam?
          </h4>
          <p>
            Having an exam is an useful opportunity to reflect on the range of content and ideas explored throughout the course. While in-person exams are an imperfect way of evaluating learning, and not a format that's optimal for everyone, I've tried to adapt it so that people who need more time or may benefit from notes can complete it to the best of their abilities. More to the point, the reality is that it's currently essential to have an AI-proof evaluation where you practice writing in your own voice. I know that many people may be English language learners or not be strong writers, but I'm not looking for polished essay-style responses, so much as evidence of you communicating your own original thoughts about the course content.
          </p>

            If you have a conflict (e.g. another exam at the same time) you can report it to the faculty registrar. More information is <a href="https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/faculty-registrar/final-exams/exam-conflicts" target="_blank">here</a>.

That means ensuring everyone has the opportunity to successfully complete this course, despite different learning styles and needs. Likewise, the university has resources to assist students of all abilities.

          As undergraduates, you are expected to take responsibility for your performance in this course, which means respecting course policies and accepting the consequences of not doing so. In the name of professionalism and ethics, the teaching team cannot bend the rules or give preferential treatment to individuals (just a friendly reminder that no one is entitled to an easy grade or free pass). However, we are here to help you and encourage you to address difficulties you may experience in the course. We also understand unexpected crises can impact your course performance, and encourage you to address these issues <em>as soon as possible</em> with both the teaching team and your college registrar (we cannot grant accomodations retroactively).

          </h4>
          <p>
            Our learning environment (including Quercus) is a shared space, which means we should be mindful and respectful of our colleagues, As we explore the histories and objects of different spaces and places, be sensitive to our various cultural and linguistic backgrounds, as well as different political and religious beliefs. I encourage students to challenge and be challenged by ideas — exposure to other views and opinions is part of the learning experience — but not without respecting such differences. If disagreements arise, try to offer constructive feedback and avoid prescriptive language. We will work together to create an environment of constructive dialogue, inclusiveness, and mutual respect. We are all in this together.

The University’s <a href="https://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/Assets/Governing+Council+Digital+Assets/Policies/PDF/ppjun011995.pdf">Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters</a> outlines the behaviours that constitute academic dishonesty and the processes for addressing academic offences. Potential offences include, but are not limited to the following:

          <p>
            Do not use generative artificial intelligence tools and apps to complete and/or support the completion of assignments in this course. The teaching team is interested in reading your observations, analyses, and insights. Your sketches demonstrate your careful looking and are not assessed on artistic skills. Using generative AI in this course will be considered an academic offence relating to the use of unauthorized aids. Thank you for helping us promote and maintain a productive learning community.

            Textual Similarity Detection Tool 
          </h4>
          <p>
            Assessments are submitted electronically through Quercus. Normally, students will be required to submit their course essays to the University’s plagiarism detection tool for a review of textual similarity and detection of possible plagiarism. In doing so, students will allow their essays to be included as source documents in the tool’s reference database, where they will be used solely for the purpose of detecting plagiarism. The terms that apply to the University’s use of this tool are described on the <a href="https://uoft.me/pdt-faq" target="_blank">Centre for Teaching Support & Innovation website (https://uoft.me/pdt-faq).</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            All suspected cases of academic dishonesty will be investigated following procedures outlined in the Code. Students are expected to seek additional information about what constitutes appropriate academic behaviour or appropriate research and citation methods from their instructors or other institutional resources.
