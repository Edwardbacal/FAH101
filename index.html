            Welcome to week 5
          </h5>
          <p>
            Hi everyone! It's the second to last week(!). 
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a great opportunity to reflect on what has been working for you in the course. If you have thoughts, concerns, or constructive feedback for the teaching team, please feel free to email myself or speak to your TA so we ensure this last half of the semester works for you. 
          </p>
          <p>
            If you submitted your first assignments by the deadline, you can expect to get it back by the end of this week. Meanwhile, <a href="#as2">assignment 2</a> is due in less than 2 weeks. Please remember to review the assignment instructions and the rubric <em>before</em> you start.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can write on any of the main monuments for this assignment; however, if you choose one of the bigger/multi-work ones (the Ajanta Caves, The Great Mosque of Damascus, Paradise Camp) you will have to choose a specific part to focus on - check the <a href="#as2">assignment 2 instructions to confirm</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also see the rubric for the ✨assignment 2 document template✨ (<a href="./assets/FAH101H1S_CompareAndContrast_Template_(YourNameGoesHere).docx" download="">.docx</a>) (<a href="./assets/FAH101H1S_CompareAndContrast_Template_(YourNameGoesHere).pages" download="">.pages</a>) (<a href="./assets/FAH101H1S_CompareAndContrast_Template_(YourNameGoesHere).pdf" target="_blank">.pdf</a>)
          </p>
          <p>
            And of course, this week's tutorial will be a good opportunity to talk about the assignment.
          </p>
          <hr style="margin: 2rem 0;">
          <p>
            Due to certain quercus settings, the first few weeks of tutorial attendance/participation weren't visible to students right away. They now have been since last week - this means you have until the end of this week (Aug 4) to dispute tutorial attendance grades. 
          </p>
          <hr style="margin: 2rem 0;">
          <p>
            The exam... is still far away. Not <em>that</em> far away, but far enough that your best course of action is to focus on assignment 2, attending tutorials, and taking your time reading the course modules.

                  The exam office is also in the process of scheduling our final exam - nothing confirmed yet, but it will probably happen early into the exam period. Right now, all the information there is to know about the exam is what's <a href="#exam">here</a>. The final tutorial (in two weeks) will focus on exam prep, as well.

                  Welcome to week 3 of class! This will be one of the busier weeks, what with assignment 1 due next Sunday, and a lot of content. But we're approaching the halfway point (!). Please see relevant updates<strong></strong><strong></strong> below!

                  There is a request for a volunteer note-taker for this course. Given that this is an online asynchronous course, I would imagine this involves tutorial notes. If you are interested, <strong>please see the message in the box below</strong>, or jump straight to signing up <strong><a class="inline_disabled" href="https://clockwork.studentlife.utoronto.ca/custom/misc/home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here!</a></strong>

                <p>
                  I hope this isn't too late, but I want to share information on free museum admission:
                </p>
                <ul class="list">
                  <li>
                    There are many options for visiting the AGO free (see <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://ago.ca/visitor-information/visit-free" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>), including Wednesdays after 6, and free general admission for Ontario residents under 25.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The ROM has free Tuesdays for post-secondary students (that includes you!), among other options (see <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.rom.on.ca/en/visit-us/admission-information" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here)</a>

                    The Aga Khan has free admission on Wednesdays after 4 (see <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://agakhanmuseum.org/plan-your-visit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here)</a>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I believe you can get free admission for all these museums (and many more places) via tpl:map (the Toronto Public Library's program for museum tickets - see <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here)</a>

                <p>
                  A student mentioned the <em>Beam with Nurat al-Sur </em>is not on view at the Aga Khan. My apologies! I'm pretty sure I saw it last May, and the website lists it as being on display, but these things happen, so in place of that, <strong>you are welcome to write on any one piece from <a class="inline_disabled" title="Link" href="https://collections.agakhanmuseum.org/collection/index.html?query=beam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this page</a> instead.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  I also updated the cover page template for assignment 1, since the formatting may have been messy (please use <a href="./assets/FAH101H1S_SketchAndAnalysis_Template_(YourNameGoesHere).docx" class="download" download>this document <i class="fa-solid fa-file-arrow-down"></i></a> for your first assignment - it includes a grading rubric you may find helpful). 
                </p>

                  Tutorials
                </h5>
                <p>
                  As noted, we expect you to attend the same tutorial section, but realize people may have gotten into the course late, when most sections were already filled, or may have schedule conflicts. In these cases, I'd rather you join another tutorial than miss the one you're enrolled in - that said,<strong></strong> I can't personally change your enrollments, so ask that you check in with me and your TA beforehand so we can keep a record of tutorial attendance (otherwise you may not get credit for a tutorial you attended!)
                </p>

                  Correction
                </h5>
                <p>
                  In module 2.1. the "Principles of Design PDF" link led to the wrong file. I added the correct link and, better yet, made a carousel with real examples on the course site (<a class="inline_disabled" title="Link" href="https://fah.lol/2.1.html#elements" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can see that here</a>).

                Hi everyone,
              </p>
              <p>
                First, a correction:
              </p>
              <p>
                There was a mistake on the course site, which listed TUT5301 twice, which meant TUT0301 was not stated, and that the tutorial discussion board for TUT0301 was not shared (it is now available). If you were confused about the location of the tutorial (Tuesday 2-3PM in OISE3312), my sincere apologies! If you still figured out where to go, thank you! However, further apologies about the discussion board. If you missed the tutorial because of this error, I will give you the credit for this week.
              </p>
              <p>
                Second, a TA change:
              </p>
              <p>
                Due to unforseen conflicts, Esther Kim will now be leading the Tuesday afternoon tutorials (after this week, Fahimeh will be leading tutorials on Wednesday). This does not affect your tutorial enrollment or anything else - please keep coming to the same place at the same time!
              </p>  
              <p>
                Thanks for understanding and bearing with these bumps as the course launches.

      <p>
        In place of lectures, this course features online modules (lessons made up of short videos, texts, and images) which explore art objects and develop your art historical skills. A group of modules will be posted on the course site each Monday. You can work through them on your own time but should aim to complete them before that week’s tutorial.

        Tutorials

        Tutorials are a mandatory part of this course and occur each week. There, you will discuss course content, practice key art historical skills, and collaborate on activities with classmates. Attendance and completion of activities make up 15% of your final grade.

        Monuments of Art History examines key works of art and architecture from antiquity to the present and from across the globe, with emphasis on the cultural roles art has played throughout history. This broad selection of artworks corresponds to subject areas taught by U of T’s Art History faculty, offering a preview of many 200-400 level courses you can take through the Department of Art History.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will pay special attention to developing foundational art historical skills, including the ability to observe, analyze, compare, and write about works of art and architecture. Tutorials will provide training in, and practice applying, the basic principles and vocabulary of art historical scholarship. Assignments are based on these skills and draw on course modules, tutorials, readings, and visits to local museums. 
      </p>
      <p>
        No previous knowledge of art or architecture is required.

            Summary
          </h4>
          <p>
            This is the first of two assignments in which you will engage with one art object, chosen from <a href="1.1.html#6">one (1) of the options presented here</a>. It consists of two parts: a sketch with notes and a written analysis.
          </p>
          <p>
            To start, select the object you feel most compelled to analyze and visit it in person. While there, create a sketch that, to the best of your abilities, depicts the object as it impresses you. As part of your sketch, include notes and/or diagrams that explain / highlight your observations about the art object.   
            
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong>
            You will not be graded on the artistic quality of the sketch. The sketch can look terrible and you can still get an A. What matters is how you demonstrate close engagement with the object through the way you record your visual observations on the page.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Next, you will write a 600-700 word formal analysis of your chosen artwork. Here you will take what you noted in making your sketch and translate your observations into a cohesive essay, applying the skills you will learn in Module 3 and practice in tutorials.
          </p>
          
          <h4>
            Objectives
          </h4>
          
          <h5>
            The sketch is meant for you to practice close engagement with art by doing the following:
          </h5>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              Slow-looking and mindful noticing: spending time with an artwork and thinking about how it strikes you (how do you take in the full work, what parts stand out, how do the details present themselves to you, etc).
            </li>
            <li>
              Recording your visual impressions by translating them into a sketch
            </li>
            <li>
              Annotating your sketch with brief notes describing what you've seen and how you've chosen to represented them. 
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <h5>
            The formal analysis asks you to demonstrate the following skills: 
          </h5>
          
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              Describing, analyzing, and formulating a thesis about an artwork.
            </li>
            <li>
              Translating visual observations and interpretations into written statements; organizing your thoughts into an essay.
            </li>
            <li>
              Posing interpretive questions about art using the Who? / What? / When? / Where? / Why? / How? format.
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            Looking ahead, this essay will prepare you for assignment 2: by preparing you to identify the ways one artwork is visually constructed, you will be ready to discuss how those qualities connect and/or distinguish multiple artworks seen together.
          </p>

            Things to consider
          </h4>
          <h5>
            For the sketch:
          </h5>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              If the object is three-dimensional, is there a best angle to view it from? Or does it need to be portrayed from multiple angles?
            </li>
            <li>
              If certain elements jump out at you, consider providing sketches of those details and parts.
            </li>
            <li>
              The hand can notice things the eyes miss - pay attention to what you notice in the act of sketching.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h5>
            For the formal analysis:
          </h5>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              Is the thesis clear? Is it specific and direct
            </li>
            <li>
              Have you used proper formatting, including standard format for listing titles of artworks (see the museum label example in section 1.3)
            </li>
            <li>
              Additional images are not required, however, if you include photos of the artwork please caption them. 
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>
            Additional instructions
          </h4>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              Write on only one work from the options listed below 
            </li>
            <li>
              Sketches can be created physically on paper or digitally in a drawing/painting app. The sketch is to be created from scratch by you and cannot be compiled from digital graphics or photographs. Annotations should engage with the sketch directly and can be handwritten or typed.
            </li>
            <li>
              No research is involved - please focus on the visual qualities of the object.
            </li>
            <li>
              We'll discuss the assignment in tutorials and in the course, with examples.

            Summary
          </h4>
          <p>
            This assignment builds on your sketch and formal analysis by comparing your chosen artwork (the same one from assignment 1) with one of the "monuments" from class (options are listed below) in order to analyze and interpret the differences/similarities between them. Whereas assignment 1 asked you to visually examine one art object in isolation, this assignment asks you to re-examine that work in relation to another, and to offer explanations—backed by references—that substantiate your observations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like in your formal analysis, you will have to include a thesis statement that distills the key claims of your analysis. Here, <strong>you will also have to cite 2 or more scholarly sources</strong> to support your claims (more on citations below).
          </p>
          <p>
            Word count: 900-1100 words (including citations and bibliography).

          </p>
          <p>
            The exam has not yet been written, but will likely consist of essay questions: one short, one medium, and one long. You will be able to choose from a selection of questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Questions will focus on broad themes and ideas explored throughout the course. You will be expected to speak to these ideas about art in relation to specific examples from the course (e.g. "how is the theme of devotion expressed across works from different cultures?"). This exam will NOT emphasis memorization or providing objective answers (you won't see questions like "what year was the Ghent Altarpiece completed?"). 
          </p>
          <p>
            You will be allowed to bring in a study-sheet: this is one (and only one) page (8.5" x 11" or similar), which you can fill with handwritten notes (no print-outs). Pro-tip, making this sheet is a great way to study. No other aids are allowed.

            The exam has not been scheduled yet. The faculty of arts and sciences schedule all exams, and I don't have any say on when and where it will take place. I just know it's during the exam period (August 15-30).
          </p>
          <p>
            It's worth 35% of your final grade (The Faculty of Arts and Sciences requires first year courses have exams that are worth at least 1/3 of your grade).
          </p>
          
          <h4>
            Why do we have an in-person exam?
          </h4>
          <p>
            Having an exam is an useful opportunity to reflect on the range of content and ideas explored throughout the course. While in-person exams are an imperfect way of evaluating learning, and not a format that's optimal for everyone, I've tried to adapt it so that people who need more time or may benefit from notes can complete it to the best of their abilities. More to the point, the reality is that it's currently essential to have an AI-proof evaluation where you practice writing in your own voice. I know that many people may be English language learners or not be strong writers, but I'm not looking for polished essay-style responses, so much as evidence of you communicating your own original thoughts about the course content.
          </p>
          
          <h4>
            What happens if I'm sick or unable to make it?
          </h4>
          
          <p>
            If you have a conflict (e.g. another exam at the same time) you can report it to the faculty registrar. More information is <a href="https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/faculty-registrar/final-exams/exam-conflicts" target="_blank">here</a>.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            If you are not able to be present for the exam, or miss it for any legitimate reason, you can contact the registrat to defer your exam. More information is <a href="https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/faculty-registrar/petitions/deferred-exams" target="_blank">here</a>.

          <p>
            Our learning environment (including Quercus) is a shared space, which means we should be mindful and respectful of our colleagues, As we explore the histories and objects of different spaces and places, be sensitive to our various cultural and linguistic backgrounds, as well as different political and religious beliefs. I encourage students to challenge and be challenged by ideas — exposure to other views and opinions is part of the learning experience — but not without respecting such differences. If disagreements arise, try to offer constructive feedback and avoid prescriptive language. We will work together to create an environment of constructive dialogue, inclusiveness, and mutual respect. We are all in this together.

            Do not use generative artificial intelligence tools and apps to complete and/or support the completion of assignments in this course.

            Textual Similarity Detection Tool

          <p>
            Assessments are submitted electronically through Quercus. Normally, students will be required to submit their course essays to the University’s plagiarism detection tool for a review of textual similarity and detection of possible plagiarism. In doing so, students will allow their essays to be included as source documents in the tool’s reference database, where they will be used solely for the purpose of detecting plagiarism. The terms that apply to the University’s use of this tool are described on the <a href="https://uoft.me/pdt-faq" target="_blank">Centre for Teaching Support & Innovation website (https://uoft.me/pdt-faq).</a>
          </p>

            All suspected cases of academic dishonesty will be investigated following procedures outlined in the Code. Students are expected to seek additional information about what constitutes appropriate academic behaviour or appropriate research and citation methods from their instructors or other institutional resources.
