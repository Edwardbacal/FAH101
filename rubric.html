      <p>
        I typically give Fs only to work that's noticeably incomplete, plagairised, or shows deliberate neglect. In any case, it shouldn't have to come to that; I'm more concerned with seeing you finish on your terms than failing your work. If you're unable to complete your work to your true ability due to exigent circumstances, please get in touch with your registrar - preferably sooner rather than later.
