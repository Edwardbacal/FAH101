    Enghelab Shod [Farsi for &ldquo;The Revolution Happened&rdquo;] is an oral history project on memories of the 1979 Iranian revolution. Our goal is to understand this grand historical event from the perspective of everyday folks who lived through it. We explore how people remember &ldquo;the revolution&rdquo; and with which places, dates, objects and emotions they associate these memories. Our project prioritizes documenting embodied and affective experiences as narrated through the lens of memory. This approach extends beyond common historiographies&rsquo; penchant for meta-narratives of political chronologies, and instead emphasizes the revolution as a complex lived experience that is diversely memorialized by people who live through it.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project is based on professionally recorded oral history interviews with diasporic Iranians in Canada. In these interviews, we ask participants to describe how they learnt that &ldquo;the revolution happened&rdquo;: when, where, and how they began to name and recognize the ongoing political unrest as the culmination of a revolution. We also ask participants to share specific artifacts that are associated with these memories. The diverse age range of our participants provides rich insight in the experience of the revolution at various life stages, including in late childhood and adolescence.
  </p>
  <p>
    The aim of this project is to create opportunities for intergenerational (and intercultural) communication about life amidst historical change, particularly for younger generations of Iranians for whom the &ldquo;revolution&rdquo; has been an abstract background to their lives. To do so, we are creating a publicly accessible online archive to showcase the recorded interviews and collected artifacts in English and Farsi. This project is informed by our own personal interest in understanding the revolution, and what it meant to live through it.

    From Allison Young, "<a href="https://smarthistory.org/shirin-neshat-rebellious-silence-women-of-allah-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shirin Neshat, <em>Rebellious Silence</em>, <em>Women of Allah</em> Series</a>," in Smarthistory, August 9, 2015.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Reading: Shirin Neshat, <em>Rebellious Silence</em>, <em>Women of Allah</em> Series
  </h3>
  
  
  
  <p>
    In <em>Rebellious Silence</em>, the central figure&rsquo;s portrait is bisected along a vertical seam created by the long barrel of a rifle. Presumably the rifle is clasped in her hands near her lap, but the image is cropped so that the gun rises perpendicular to the lower edge of the photo and grazes her face at the lips, nose, and forehead. The woman&rsquo;s eyes stare intensely towards the viewer from both sides of this divide.
  </p>
  <p>
    Shirin Neshat&rsquo;s photographic series <em>Women of Allah</em> examines the complexities of women&rsquo;s identities in the midst of a changing cultural landscape in the Middle East&mdash;both through the lens of Western representations of Muslim women, and through the more intimate subject of personal and religious conviction.
  </p>
  <p>
    While the composition&mdash;defined by the hard edge of her black chador against the bright white background&mdash;appears sparse, measured and symmetrical, the split created by the weapon implies a more violent rupture or psychic fragmentation. A single subject, it suggests, might be host to internal contradictions alongside binaries such as tradition and modernity, East and West, beauty and violence. In the artist&rsquo;s own words, &ldquo;every image, every woman&rsquo;s submissive gaze, suggests a far more complex and paradoxical reality behind the surface.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    The <em>Women of Allah</em> series confronts this &ldquo;paradoxical reality&rdquo; through a haunting suite of black-and-white images. Each contains a set of four symbols that are associated with Western representations of the Muslim world: the veil, the gun, the text and the gaze. While these symbols have taken on a particular charge since 9/11, the series was created earlier and reflects changes that have taken place in the region since 1979, the year of the Islamic Revolution in Iran.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Islamic Revolution
  </h4>
  <p>
    Iran had been ruled by the Shah (Mohammad Reza Pahlavi), who took power in 1941 during the Second World War and reigned as King until 1979, when the Persian monarchy was overthrown by revolutionaries. His dictatorship was known for the violent repression of political and religious freedom, but also for its modernization of the country along Western cultural models. Post-war Iran was an ally of Britain and the United States, and was markedly progressive with regards to women&rsquo;s rights. The Shah&rsquo;s regime, however, steadily grew more restrictive, and revolutionaries eventually rose to abolish the monarchy in favor of a conservative religious government headed by Ayatollah Khomeini.
  </p>
  <p>
    Shirin Neshat was born in 1957 in the town of Qazvin. In line with the Shah&rsquo;s expansion of women&rsquo;s rights, her father prioritized his daughters&rsquo; access to education, and the young artist attended a Catholic school where she learned about both Western and Iranian intellectual and cultural history. She left, however, in the mid-1970s, pursuing her studies in California as the environment in Iran grew increasingly hostile. It would be seventeen years before she returned to her homeland. When she did, she confronted a society that was completely opposed to the one that she had grown up in.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Looking Back
  </h4>
  <p>
    One of the most visible signs of cultural change in Iran has been the requirement for all women to wear the veil in public. While many Muslim women find this practice empowering and affirmative of their religious identities, the veil has been coded in Western eyes as a sign of Islam&rsquo;s oppression of women. This opposition is made more clear, perhaps, when one considers the simultaneity of the Islamic Revolution with women&rsquo;s liberation movements in the U.S. and Europe, both developing throughout the 1970s. Neshat decided to explore this fraught symbol in her art as a way to reconcile her own conflicting feelings. In Women of Allah, initiated shortly after her return to Iran in 1991, the veil functions as both a symbol of freedom and of repression.
  </p>
  <h4>
    The Veil and the Gaze
  </h4>
  <p>
    The veil is intended to protect women&rsquo;s bodies from becoming the sexualized object of the male gaze, but it also protects women from being seen at all. The &ldquo;gaze&rdquo; in this context becomes a charged signifier of sexuality, sin, shame, and power. Neshat is cognizant of feminist theories that explain how the &ldquo;male gaze&rdquo; is normalized in visual and popular culture: Women&rsquo;s bodies are commonly paraded as objects of desire in advertising and film, available to be looked at without consequence. Many feminist artists have used the action of &ldquo;gazing back&rdquo; as a means to free the female body from this objectification. The gaze, here, might also reflect exotic fantasies of the East. In Orientalist painting of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, for instance, Eastern women are often depicted nude, surrounded by richly colored and patterned textiles and decorations; women are envisaged amongst other beautiful objects that can be possessed. In Neshat&rsquo;s images, women return the gaze, breaking free from centuries of subservience to male or European desire.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most of the subjects in the series are photographed holding a gun, sometimes passively, as in Rebellious Silence, and sometimes threateningly, with the muzzle pointed directly towards the camera lens. With the complex ideas of the &ldquo;gaze&rdquo; in mind, we might reflect on the double meaning of the word &ldquo;shoot,&rdquo; and consider that the camera&mdash;especially during the colonial era&mdash;was used to violate women&rsquo;s bodies. The gun, aside from its obvious references to control, also represents religious martyrdom, a subject about which the artist feels ambivalently, as an outsider to Iranian revolutionary culture.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Poetry
  </h4>
  <p>
    The contradictions between piety and violence, empowerment and suppression, are most prevalent in the use of calligraphic text that is applied to each photograph. Western viewers who do not read Farsi may understand the calligraphy as an aesthetic signifier, a reference to the importance of text in the long history of Islamic art. Yet, most of the texts are transcriptions of poetry and other writings by women, which express multiple viewpoints and date both before and after the Revolution. Some of the texts that Neshat has chosen are feminist in nature. However, in Rebellious Silence, the script that runs across the artist&rsquo;s face is from Tahereh Saffarzadeh&rsquo;s poem &ldquo;Allegiance with Wakefulness&rdquo; which honors the conviction and bravery of martyrdom. Reflecting the paradoxical nature of each of these themes, histories and discourses, the photograph is both melancholic and powerful&mdash;invoking the quiet and intense beauty for which Neshat&rsquo;s work has become known.
  </p>
  <p>
    As an outspoken, feminist and progressive artist, Neshat is aware that it would be dangerous to show her work in conservative modern-day Iran, and she has been living in exile in the United States since the 1990s. For audiences in the West, the &ldquo;Women of Allah&rdquo; series has allowed a more nuanced contemplation of common stereotypes and assumptions about Muslim women, and serves to challenge the suppression of female voices in any community.

    Reading: Beyond Gender: Indigenous Perspectives, Fa&rsquo;afafine and Fa&rsquo;afatama
  </h3>
  
  
  
  
  
</h3>
<p>
  In fact, numerous Indigenous communities around the world do not conflate gender and sex; rather, they recognize a third or more genders within their societies. Individuals that identify as a third gender many times have visible and socially recognizable positions within their societies and sometimes are thought to have unique or supernatural power that they can access because of their gender identity. However, as European influence and westernized ideologies began to spread and were, in many cases, forced upon Indigenous societies, third genders diminished, along with so many other Indigenous cultural traditions. Nevertheless, the cultural belief and acceptance of genders beyond a binary system still exist in traditional societies around the world. In many cases, these third gender individuals represent continuing cultural traditions and maintain aspects of cultural identity within their communities.
</p>
<p>
  Within a Western and Christian ideological framework, individuals who identify as a third gender are often thought of as part of the LGBTQ community. This classification actually distorts the concept of a third gender and reflects a culture that historically recognizes only two genders based on sex assigned at birth&mdash;male or female&mdash;and anyone acting outside of the cultural norms for their sex may be classified as homosexual, gender queer, or transgender, among other classifications. In societies that recognize a third gender, the gender classification is not based on sexual identity, but rather on gender identity and spirituality. Individuals who identify with a cultural third gender are, in fact, acting within their gender/sex norm.
</p>
<h4>
  Fa&rsquo;afafine and Fa&rsquo;afatama, Samoa 
</h4>
<p>
  Many third gender individuals hold integral roles within societies and are well respected for their strength, hard work, and ability to discuss taboo topics. On the island of Samoa, there are four recognized cultural genders: female, male, fa&rsquo;afafine, and fa&rsquo;afatama. Fa&rsquo;afafine and fa&rsquo;afatama are fluid gender roles that move between male and female worlds. These third and fourth gender groups tend to care for elders in the community and educate others about sex, a topic considered taboo in public conversations for male and female genders.

<p>
  One of the lasting cultural performances both preserved and revamped by fa'afafine and fa'afatama is the dance of the taupou. The taupou, or ceremonial hostess typically selected by the high chief in the village, is charged with representing and entertaining visitors. Traditionally, the taupou's dignity and grace expressed the ideals of appropriate female behavior. These displays were particularly favored by Christian missionaries that idealized the taupou's "virginal" and virtuous qualities. Today, when fa'afafine and fa'afatama participate in pageants, they will sometimes take on the role of the taupou, displaying grace and femininity while also making a caricature of the Christian-colonial ideal through sexual humor and body language. This take on the taupou's performance demonstrates the unique ability for fa'fafine and fa'afatama to transcend gender roles and leverage their skills to open the door for discussion on taboo subject through humor.
</p>


<p>
  As ceremonial hosts, taupou wear traditional Samoan dress, such as the ʻie tōga which is a finely woven mat worn tightly wrapped around the body. These mats traditionally have unwoven fringe at the edge and a strip of red feathers.
</p>
<p>
  Crucial to the outfit is the ula nifo, a whale tooth necklace, a status symbol usually restricted to chiefs and their offspring, and likely an element held over from the days when the taupou was only performed by the virgin daughter of a chief. This necklace is made of sliced sperm whale teeth, and it was collected in Fiji in the 1890s. At that time the collector noted, &ldquo;this ornament has the same relative value as a diamond necklace&hellip;&rdquo; indicating that this type necklace was highly prized by many Polynesian cultures.

<h4>
  Fa&rsquo;afafine and Fa&rsquo;afatama still thrive today. 
</h4>
<p>
  In today&rsquo;s dances, the taupou will carry a lightweight replica of a nifo&lsquo;oti, a large club modeled after cane knives of early nineteenth-century English and American whalers. Carrying these during the dance is reminiscent of pre-battle performances where heirloom clubs were artfully twirled and thrown to demonstrate the warrior&rsquo;s prowess. This club was collected in Samoa between 1908&ndash;1910.
</p>
<p>
  Today, one of the ways fa&rsquo;afafine and fa&rsquo;afatama contribute to the care of elders is by participating in the popular beauty pageants whose proceeds go to charities like Mapuifagalele, Western Samoa&rsquo;s home for the aged. In these pageants, fa&rsquo;afafine and fa&rsquo;afatama often perform the dance of the taupou. The portrayal by fa&rsquo;afafine and fa&rsquo;afatama of taupou in these beauty pageants carries a different kind of message than when it was traditionally performed by the virgin daughter of a chief; however, the grace, beauty, and poise of the taupou continues to be the core message of the dance.

    To Watch: Yuki Kihara: <em>Paradise Camp</em> at the Venice Biennale 2022
  </h3>
  <p>
    Starting this week (Week 10), we can engage with videos of the artists who created the monuments being examined. On the previous page, we heard from Shirin Neshat about her reflections as an artist and an Iranian woman. To wrap up our exploration of identities this week, we will listen to Yuki Kihara, who is of mixed Japanese and Samoan heritage, <a href="https://youtu.be/w3BTJ9SPPHU?si=SJiLIHGNiZsM5ECJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talk about showcasing queer rights and revealing the toxic influence of colonialism in her works (12:42, video)</a>. Select "CC" in the video for closed captioning.
  </p>
  <p>
    The artist Yuki Kihara (b. 1975), who is of Japanese and Samoan descent, brought some tropical sunshine and more than a flash of gender political heat into the gloomy depths of Venice&rsquo;s Arsenale, with a presentation that foregrounds queer rights, small island ecologies and decolonization, among other hot topics.
  </p>
  <p>
    As the first artist to represent New Zealand in Venice who identifies as Pasifika, Asian and fa&rsquo;afafine (Samoan for someone who is born male but presents &ldquo;in the manner of a woman&rdquo;), Kihara is pulling no punches. Her installation, <em>Paradise Camp</em>, was inspired by an essay by Ngahuia Te Awekotuku that was presented at a Paul Gauguin Symposium in 1992, at the Auckland Art Gallery, drawing attention to the sexual ambiguity of some of the characters so vividly evoked by Gauguin. Kihara has repaid the compliment by staging photos inspired by Gauguin&rsquo;s Tahiti paintings, using sites and people of Samoan origin, to reflect those similarities and celebrate Gauguin&rsquo;s recognition of non-western and non-binary beauty. These are on show in Venice, as is a new film, also called Paradise Camp. Shot on location in Upolu Island, Samoa, it features a local cast and crew, mostly drawn from the the fa&rsquo;afafine community, and its various chapters include one segment that playfully interrogates indigenous vs. colonial attitudes to art and culture, featuring a group of &ldquo;ordinary Samoans&rdquo; who end up mocking and deconstructing the kind of white cultural tropes that are taken for granted in Europe, but are unfamiliar in Samoan art education.
  </p>
  <p>
    Kihara, who works across photography, film, performance, curation and installations, studied fashion design at Wellington Polytechnic (now Massey University). While she was still a student, the National Museum of New Zealand, Te Papa Tongarewa, purchased a work of hers, a rare accolade. The work was <a href="https://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/object/216354" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Graffiti Dress &mdash; Bombacific</em></a>, which blended 26 T-shirts featuring corporate logos into one fabulous creation. In 2008, she had a solo show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Entitled <em>Living Photographs</em>, it explored the exotic poses and tableaus captured by 19th-century colonial and non-indigenous photographers, such as Thomas Andrew and Alfred John Tattersall, which had helped to spread inaccurate stereotypes about Pacific islanders and their culture, many of which still prevail. [Recall our study of Gottfried Lindauer's portraits of the Māori from Week 7. What overlapping themes and issues are present in Yuki Kihara's works?]
  </p>
  <p>
    Kihara&rsquo;s work is now in the MoMA collection, the Te Papa Tongarewa Museum, Queensland Art Gallery &amp; Gallery of Modern Art, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the British Museum and Kaohsiung Museum of Fine Arts, Taiwan.

    A Brief History of Theory in Art History
  </h3>
  <p>
    After ten weeks of FAH101H1F, I know you are all enthralled with the prospect of studying more art history! As noted in Week 1, art historians ask a lot of questions to gain an understanding of the artists, patrons, function, audience, reception, style, and iconography of each work. To support this work, art historians engage with theories to inform our work.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Watch</strong> <a href="https://youtu.be/Wn2Azw47bW0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">James Elkins' "A Brief History of Theory in Art History" video (22:29)</a> for a talk about the ways people have thought about theories (semiotics, feminism, iconography, deconstruction, psychoanalysis, style analysis, connoisseurship, etc.) and theorists (Panofsky, W&ouml;lfflin, Ranci&egrave;re, Laruelle, Malabou, Foucault, Deleuze, etc.) in the discipline of art history. Select "CC" in the video for closed captioning.
  </p>
  <p>
    There was a period before art history called its interpretive methods "theories," and then a period in which art historians identified what they did, and implicitly distinguished it from what neighbouring disciplines did, by enumerating their theories. In the 21st century theories have proliferated, but so has the idea that art historians don't need or use theories and that inquiry can be guided by the objects themselves or by any number of individual texts. Through all these changes there's been the question of what art history does differently from other fields.
  </p>

    James Elkins is E.C. Chadbourne Professor in the Department of Art History, Theory, and Criticism, School of the Art Institute of Chicago. His most recent book is <em>What Photography Is</em>. He writes on art and non-art images; recent books include <em>Chinese Landscape Painting as Western Art History</em> (Hong Kong University Press) and <em>Art Critiques: A Guide</em> (New Academia).

  <h3>
    Two Brief Readings
  </h3>
  <p>
    As we consider the skills we need for further art historical analyses and discussions, it is helpful to explore the methodological debates that have shaped and continue to shape the discipline. Let's start by reading two brief sections&mdash;Introduction and A Variety of Interpretations: A Preview from Michael Hatt and Charlotte Klonk's <em>Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods</em> (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2006).

  <h4>
    Amiable Protest and Africouture
  </h4>
  <p>
    "In a way, when people see an artist of African origin, they think: oh, he is here to protest. Yes, okay. I am here to protest, but I am going to do it like a gentleman. It is going to look very nice. You are not even going to realize that I am protesting, you are going to invite me to your museum because the work is nice, and then when I am inside, it is too late. But I have to do it nicely&mdash;because if I am already coming to you with a knife, you're going to send me away."
  </p>
  <p>
    Yinka Shonibare CBE was born in London and raised in Nigeria. He studied art at Goldsmiths College in London and today is one of the most widely known and successful Afro-British artists. In 2019, he was given the title Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire and has since added the acronym CBE to his official name. Well-versed in postcolonial cultural theory, Shonibare sees himself as a "postcolonial hybrid" who practices the genteel restraint of a British gentleman and has gained access to the most prestigious museums of the Western world with his exquisitely tailored parodies of the lifestyle of the British upper classes. Shonibare's amiable and stylistically consummate subversion consists in his signature use of double-sided, colourfully printed cotton fabrics to invade the art and museum worlds. Seen as typically African, the fabrics are a telling example of global colonial entanglements; known as Dutch wax, the fabrics were originally created in an attempt to imitate the patterns of the elaborately handcrafted Indonesian batik fabrics and produce them on an industrial scale in a textile printing process.
  </p>
  
  <h4>
    Art Term: Postcolonial Art
  </h4>
  <p>
    Postcolonial art refers to art produced in response to the aftermath of colonial rule, frequently addressing issues of national and cultural identity, race and ethnicity. Refer to the <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/p/postcolonial-art" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tate's online glossary</a> for more.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    However, the new mass product failed to be successful in the Dutch colony and, in the nineteenth century, found its way to West Africa, where a market for the printed cotton fabrics developed. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the fabrics came to be designed and produced mainly in the Netherlands and England, while Africa became the largest market for them. Today, much of the production takes place in Africa and China; only the most expensive fabrics are made in Holland. The Dutch town of Helmond near Eindhoven is where Vlisco's exquisite patterns are created, which are then used to tailor "Africouture" clothing in West Africa. And this is also where Shonibare obtains the fabrics for his postcolonial role plays and ironic deconstructions of Victorian traditions and customs.
  </p>
  <p>
    The hybrid history of the wax prints and their multifarious symbolic appropriation as an expression of supposed authenticity, fashionable individuality and cultural belonging reveal the ambivalent and asymmetric relationship between colonial power and colonized, which persists to the present day. Shonibare's subversive strategy, meanwhile, consists in harnessing the colonial past and postcolonial present of his industrially manufactured material to create works which visually seduce the viewer, while at the same time revealing themselves as self-reflective constructs. His work relies on theatricality and employs visual alienating effects which comment on and, in doing so, subvert the beautiful or historical illusion. Similar to the concept of metafiction used in postmodern literary theory, he seeks to critically examine the relationship of art and life by means of parody? When dressing headless figures in Victorian fashion, bedecking interiors with pseudo-African fabrics or staging himself in a period series as an admired black dandy of the Victorian Empire, he always occupies a dual position which, incapable of being assimilated or exoticized, instead explores the third space where cultures meet and mix. The objective of Shonibare's playful visual grammar is to show hybridity, while at the same time consistently frustrating any desire for authenticity in the sense of a longing for immediacy, originality, genuineness and purity.

  <p>
    England's rise to colonial world power from the eighteenth century on serves as the preferred historical backdrop for his installations. For his early work <em>The Victorian Philanthropist's Parlour</em> (1996&ndash;1997) Shonibare already recreated a Victorian drawing room with chair, chaise longue, tables, carpets, fireplace and mirror. The persuasive power of a Victorian period room in this conceptual work is already countered by its set-like appearance, but even more effective are the wax prints with which the artist upholstered the walls and all the furniture and which are printed with colourful floral patterns and images of African footballers. This anachronism serves both to blur the boundary between fiction and historiography and to visualize British colonial rule and its consequences. In this ostensible stage set of British domestic life and culture, Shonibare enacts the drama of postcolonialism.
  </p>
  <p>
    The by now iconic photo series <em>Diary of a Victorian Dandy</em>, which in 1998 was placarded in numerous stations of the London Underground, featured Shonibare himself in the Victorian interior, appearing as a Victorian-African dandy whose daily routine is depicted in five tableaux vivants. Each time, the Black artist is the centre of attention and the composition; all admiring eyes of his white servants, friends and guests are on him when he is awakened in the morning, discusses business matters in the library and subsequently plays billiards. The evening is spent in the company of beautiful women and with the accompaniment of chamber music, with the final picture showing late-night debauchery involving both sexes. Shonibare presents impossible situations by drawing on the conversation pieces of William Hogarth and inverting the hierarchy of skin colour, so that the racist regime of the gaze underlying this type of genre painting is made obvious. Not interested in Hogarth's moralism, he instead presents and celebrates sexual excess, lavish luxury and the wilful and anti-bourgeois decadence of the dandy. Shonibare's relationship to the Victorian era is ambivalent; on the one hand, he is personally fascinated with Victorian style, refined luxury and the exquisite taste of the British aristocracy, but on the other, he emphasizes the inhuman flipside of the Victorian era: "Of course I realized, as an African, that Victorian values for me, were very draconian&hellip; The Victorians colonized Afrika. Basically, the Victorians made Africans work to produce a great empire. So Victorian values, to me, were values of repression, values of making me feel inferior."
  </p>
  <p>
    With <em>Scramble for Africa</em> (2003), Shonibare created a particularly impressive tableau illustrating the colonization of the African continent and the imperial cupidity of the European powers. This expansive installation references the Congo Conference which took place in Berlin in 1884&ndash;85 and served as the basis for the colonial partitioning of Africa. A contemporary map of Africa showing the then current state of European occupation is embedded in the middle of the oblong conference table. Seated at it are fourteen headless figures clad in Dutch wax who represent the states participating in the conference and whose "scramble" augurs the so-called race for Africa. By the turn of the century, the participating colonial powers had already divided ninety percent of the territory of Africa among themselves.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Globe Heads, World Views and Aliens
  </h4>
  
  
  
  <p>
    Ever since the late 1990s, Shonibare had been employing exceptionally well-dressed, but headless mannequins to both celebrate and satirise the gallantries, excesses, duels and bucolic leisure activities, in short, the decadent and sumptuous lifestyle of polite society or, alternatively, the quest for knowledge of Europe's educated classes. As guillotined or headless bodies, the figures are robbed of their individuality, more illusion than reality, their skin colour ambiguous&mdash;they are bearers of cultural patterns, instruments of deception, objects of desire and reflect historical experiences and power relations.
  </p>
  <p>
    More recently, a keen interest in cartography and globes has been evident in Shonibare's work. In his reconfigurations of classical sculptures, again featuring the typical Dutch wax batik design, the heads have been replaced with hand-coloured globes. Through this critical gesture in the beautiful guise of classical aesthetics, Shonibare calls for historical multi-perspectivity and a rethinking of space, mobility and cultural identity. The binary division of the world into "we" and "the others", East and West, First and Third World is, after all, based on strict rules of inclusion and exclusion. Moreover, the current geopolitical order is dynamic, and the present-day phrase "the Global South", as an orienting term for the non-hegemonic regions of this world, already represents a reordering of geography, at least in terms of societal and economic dynamics.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>The World at the Time of the Surrealists</em>, a surrealist world map published in the Belgian magazine <em>Vari&eacute;t&eacute;s</em> in 1929, already depicted a world whose familiar contours have gone out of whack. In it certain countries and world regions gain significantly in size, while others have become infinitesimally small. The Soviet Union and China are among the winners, some regions, however, have increased tremendously in size, including the island world of the South Pacific which dominates the centre of the new world map. Alaska and Greenland as well as Mexico and Peru also appear significantly larger, whereas the British Isles have moved to the far western edge of the surreal world image and, shrunk to miniature size, appear smaller than the Hawaiian island chain in the Pacific. The USA have completely disappeared and all that is left of France is Paris, the capital of Surrealism. The playfully curving equatorial line may imply that the map not only counters European reason by offering a different topography, but also that a world of the unconscious, fantasy and imagination is entered. Of central importance, however, is the discrediting of the colonial powers expressed in this subversive map picture.

    World images may be understood as a way of giving form to beliefs through which humans reassure themselves of their place in the world and the world as such. They are based on time- and culture-bound assumptions about the world and manifest themselves in world maps which, while indispensable as tools to visually communicate knowledge, invariably offer mere model-like representations of the earth and as planar projections visualize very different viewpoints and culturally determined perceptual conventions. Shonibare has applied his aesthetic concept of playful hybridity and sly, ironic reframing of cultural and visual stereotypes also to Christian imaginings of the world in the Latin Middle Ages. Commissioned to create work for Hereford Cathedral in West England, he engaged in an in-depth study of the medieval world map located there. The largest and most important surviving universal map of the Middle Ages, it was created for the cathedral around 1300 by Richard de Haldingham. The map is drawn on a single sheet of vellum using black, red, blue or green and gold ink and mounted on an oak panel. The monumental panel shows the earth as a flat, almost circular land mass traversed by rivers and mountain ranges, interspersed with seas and lakes and encircled by a narrow strip of ocean. The map relies on a basic model of representation going back to antiquity: it is a so-called "T-O map," meaning a circular, O-shaped image of the world divided into three parts by bodies of water arranged in the shape of a T. Depicting the ecumenical community as <em>orbis tripartitus</em> with the three continents known at the time, the east-oriented map shows Asia taking up the entire upper semicircle and Europe and Africa the left and right half of the lower semicircle. The Mediterranean, the Don and the Nile are located in the midst of the three continents. Not a travel map, the Hereford map is to be understood as a universal <em>imago mundi</em>, an image of the world. In the centre of the map, and thus of the world, appears Jerusalem, the city from which the history of salvation started out. Strikingly, Europe includes considerably more topographical details, rivers and cities than Asia or Africa. The farther you move away from city-rich Europe and from Asia Minor and North Africa towards the edges, the wilder and more inhospitable the areas and the stronger the animals and human beings you encounter on your graphic hike. You meet legendary peoples, hybrid creatures and curious animals scattered across the entire earth backdrop. India and Ethiopia have the largest share of them: India is home to the sciapods, the pygmies and the giants, the mouthless people, the manticore and the unicorn. North of lndia, in Scythia and neighbouring countries and islands, we encounter humans with horse's hooves, long-eared people and man-eaters. Ethiopia is home to satyrs and fauns, to long-lipped people and ones with faces between the shoulders and on the chest. Some of the wondrous beings must, in fact, have left their ancestral homelands following the discovery of America, for the European conquerors spotted dog-headed creatures (cynocephali) and headless Blemmyes in Latin America as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    The dwellers at the earth's edge shown in the Hereford map refer to numerous fantastic mythical creatures which already preoccupied the ancient authors. Pliny's <em>Natural History</em> and <em>De mirabilibus mundi</em>, a "collection of curiosities" compiled by the late antique polyhistor Solinus who is repeatedly mentioned in the mop, passed down those mythological narrative which forced the church fathers to somehow explain whether the human-like "monsters" could have been part of the divine plan of creation. Saint Augustine was convinced that, provided they were indeed human beings, they had to have descended from Adam and Eve or from Noah's sons as legitimate images of God. The Bible doesn't say anything about how Noah divided the large cake called earth among his sons, but it is assumed that he gave the biggest and best piece to his firstborn son, Shem. The next best one went to Japheth and then all that was left for Ham, who had been cursed by his father, was Africa. In the clerical theory of descent, Ham thus became the progenitor of the Africans, condemned by his father to be his brothers' servant. Thus, the right to oppress and enslave was derived from the miracle of creation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Shonibare's approach to the hybrid creatures and projections of the Hereford Mappa Mundi is, again, that of playful parody. Conveniently, hybridity is essentially the defining feature of those living at the earth's edge. In the catalogue of origin myths and fictitious genealogies, they represent the radical and uncanny Other and thus reflect a massive Occidental ethnocentrism. Shonibare, however, converts this exclusion into elegant exclusivity by celebrating the peculiarity and eccentricity of those figments of the imagination and turns them into aliens fallen from the sky who, equipped with parachutes, float in the air or have already landed. Other-worldly creatures, they are oddballs in decorative surroundings who are appreciated and respected for their peculiarity. The brightly colourful textile works present a cheerful deconstruction and reversal of dark stereotypes. The 2019 exhibition <em>Creatures of the Mappa Mundi</em> shown at Hereford Cathedral is an impressive document of inclusion and emancipation, as Shonibare and his cooperation partners managed to get various local groups of marginalized people involved in the production of the truly wonderful creatures. In this way, a different story is told.

  <h3>
    To Explore: <em>End of Empire</em> by Yinka Shonibare CBE
  </h3>
  <p>
    <em>End of Empire</em> by Yinka Shonibare CBE is a striking work featuring two figures dressed in the artist&rsquo;s signature Dutch wax batik fabric, seated on a Victorian see-saw which slowly pivots in the space. This powerful imagery imitates the shifting points of balance in world politics over the course of World War I and the ensuing colonial fallout. The figures&rsquo; heads are replaced by globes, the maps depicting geopolitical borders as they were drawn in 1917. The bodies are clothed in Victorian suits, their colonial implications skewed by the brightly coloured fabric that, in Shonibare&rsquo;s own words, is &ldquo;Ethnisicing the Aristocracy&rdquo;. This is characteristic of the artist&rsquo;s engaged and critical approach, which uses appealing imagery and light-hearted insertions such as the see-saw to tackle important issues head on. First exhibited in 2016 at Turner Contemporary, Margate, UK, <em>End of Empire</em> was created by Shonibare as part of 14&ndash;18 NOW, a programme of World War I Centenary Art commissions to commemorate the First World War.

    Yinka Shonibare CBE RA was born in 1962 in London, UK. He studied Fine Art at Byam School of Art, London (now Central Saint Martins College) in 1989 and received his MFA from Goldsmiths, University of London in 1991. Shonibare&rsquo;s interdisciplinary practice uses citations of Western art history and literature to question the validity of contemporary cultural and national identities within the context of globalization. His trademark material is the brightly coloured Dutch wax batik fabric he buys in London. This fabric was inspired by Indonesian design, mass-produced by the Dutch and eventually sold to the colonies in West Africa. In the 1960s, the material became a new symbol of African identity and independence.

    To Watch: Wangechi Mutu and the Role of Artists and Art
  </h3>
  <p>
    In this course, we have "read" various art objects and monuments and considered how artists embed art with guidance for viewing and understanding. Art reveals where we came from, where we are at present, and where we are heading. For the penultimate monument of this course, we are examining the world of Wangechi Mutu. <a href="https://www.ted.com/speakers/wangechi_mutu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mutu's TED Talk profile</a> describes the visual artist:
  </p>
  <p>
    "In expansive work that incorporates painting, sculpture, collage, film, installation and performance art, Wangechi Mutu centers on the creation of hybrid creatures that explore themes of power, culture, femininity, colonial history and global consumption. Her art is often made of multiple materials, creating fantastical forms that evoke Afrofuturism and interspecies connections. Born in Nairobi, Kenya, Mutu has held various acclaimed museum and gallery shows around the world, exhibiting in cities including London, Hong Kong, Venice and Brussels. For her exhibition <em>The NewOnes, will free Us</em>, she installed four iconic bronze sculptures in front of The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. A solo show of new work opened at the New Museum in New York in March, 2023."

  <h4>
    Art Term: Afrofuturism
  </h4>
  <p>
    Afrofuturism is a cultural aesthetic that combines science-fiction, history and fantasy to explore the African-American experience and aims to connect those from the black diaspora with their forgotten African ancestry. Refer to the <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/a/afrofuturism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tate's online glossary</a> for more.

    Reading: Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&rsquo;o on What It Means To Be Kenyan
  </h3>
  
  
  
  <p>
    Kọ́l&aacute; T&uacute;bọ̀s&uacute;n explores Kenyan identity with the celebrated author. Originally posted on <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/story/ng%C5%A9g%C4%A9-wa-thiong%E2%80%99o-on-what-it-means-to-be-kenyan/BQWRX_9H-dfvTQ?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Arts &amp; Culture</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&rsquo;o, born in January of 1938, is a foremost Kenyan writer, professor, and language activist &mdash; probably the best known Kenyan writer today. His renown, work, and activism has won him fans and several awards worldwide for his novels, plays, short stories, and essays.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2016, his short story, Ituĩka Rĩa Mũrũngarũ: Kana Kĩrĩa Gĩtũmaga Andũ Mathiĩ Marũngiĩ (The Upright Revolution: Or Why Humans Walk Upright) became the most translated African short story, currently in over fifty languages. It was written originally in Kikuyu, the writer&rsquo;s first language&mdash;which all his stories since the seventies have been written in, before they get translated into other languages.
  </p>
  <p>
    I myself have translated the story into Yor&ugrave;b&aacute;, having met the writer at a literary festival in Abẹ́&ograve;kuta, Nigeria, in 2016. I have since collaborated with him on other projects enough to call him a mentor, father-figure, and friend. In this interview, I talk to him important cultural issues, his career, and Kenya, his native land.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>How would you describe "the people of Kenya" to someone who has never met them or even heard about the country?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Beautiful. Talented. Hardworking. Enterprising. The country is a vibrant space of the different cultural streams of African, Asian, and European origins. Its landscape and history have become part of the global imagination.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>What does "identity" mean to you?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Identity is an ever changing unity of difference and sameness; particularity and universality. Identity is the imagined container of multitudes. I am Gĩkũyũ, meaning I share a certain history with all who call themselves Gĩkũyũ, but I am also Kenyan, meaning I share a geographic and historical space with all other Kenyans. I am African. I am black. I&rsquo;m a citizen of the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>In which way has the notion of your identity changed over the years?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    It follows from the above that notions of identity, especially the name we give to it, change all the time. The particulars of experience change but the universal element of being, bound up in the particular, remains. Particularity is the form of being. Universality is the commonality of being. Identity is their unity.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>How has being part of the Kikuyu community influenced your life and outlook?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    I have shared my story in my memoirs: Dreams in a Time of War; In the House of the Interpreter; Birth of a Dreamweaver, and Wrestling with the Devil. I am still writing it through my actions. I was born in a home of four mothers, one father, and several siblings. My biological mother, Wanjikũ, is the most important influence on my life. She always wanted to know if I had tried my best, in whatever I did. But I am also a product of Gikuyu history and culture.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Today, 44 communities are officially registered by the Kenyan government and there are conversations about adding more to the list. Is there an object or a location that you consider to be a symbol of all these communities coming together?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    We are a people just like any other peoples of our globe. But as Kenyan peoples, we share a common history of struggle against colonialism. I grew up within the wider history of resistance to British colonial state, which, led by the Kenya Land and Freedom Army (the one the British misnamed Mau Mau) helped bring about our Independence in 1963. We share aspiration for a Kenya in which every child has access to adequate food, housing, education, and health.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>How would you define the identity of Kenya as a nation today?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    The Kenyan identity is a work in progress. We struggle to be the best that Kenya can be. For this, we have to continue to struggle to secure our economic, political, and cultural base, all threatened by largely Western financial, and other, corporations. We have to continue to struggle against the gross social and income inequalities within our own country.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>What is your favourite saying in any Kenyan language and why?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Gũtirĩ ũtukũ ũtakĩa: &ldquo;There is no night so long that will not see the light of dawn.&rdquo; My mother, Wanjikũ, used to tell me this proverb. In times of challenges and adversity, I always recall the saying to instill in me resistance against succumbing to the negative. The saying is an expression of optimism.

    To Analyze and Read: <em>MamaRay</em> (2020)
  </h3>
  <p>
    Take some time to closely look at and analyze Wangechi Mutu's <em>MamaRay</em> sculpture. What details do you notice first and why? Which angle(s) are you supposed to engage and interact with the sculpture? How did the Mutu use the elements of art and principles of design within the sculpture? After spending some time analyzing <em>MamaRay</em>, read the following excerpt from Margot Norton et al., <em>Wangechi Mutu: Intertwined</em> (London: Phaidon Press Limited, 2023).
