    England's rise to colonial world power from the eighteenth century on serves as the preferred historical backdrop for his installations. For his early work <em>The Victorian Philanthropist's Parlour</em> (1996&ndash;1997) Shonibare already recreated a Victorian drawing room with chair, chaise longue, tables, carpets, fireplace and mirror. The persuasive power of a Victorian period room in this conceptual work is already countered by its set-like appearance, but even more effective are the wax prints with which the artist upholstered the walls and all the furniture and which are printed with colourful floral patterns and images of African footballers. This anachronism serves both to blur the boundary between fiction and historiography and to visualize British colonial rule and its consequences. In this ostensible stage set of British domestic life and culture, Shonibare enacts the drama of postcolonialism.
  </p>
  <p>
    The by now iconic photo series <em>Diary of a Victorian Dandy</em>, which in 1998 was placarded in numerous stations of the London Underground, featured Shonibare himself in the Victorian interior, appearing as a Victorian-African dandy whose daily routine is depicted in five tableaux vivants. Each time, the Black artist is the centre of attention and the composition; all admiring eyes of his white servants, friends and guests are on him when he is awakened in the morning, discusses business matters in the library and subsequently plays billiards. The evening is spent in the company of beautiful women and with the accompaniment of chamber music, with the final picture showing late-night debauchery involving both sexes. Shonibare presents impossible situations by drawing on the conversation pieces of William Hogarth and inverting the hierarchy of skin colour, so that the racist regime of the gaze underlying this type of genre painting is made obvious. Not interested in Hogarth's moralism, he instead presents and celebrates sexual excess, lavish luxury and the wilful and anti-bourgeois decadence of the dandy. Shonibare's relationship to the Victorian era is ambivalent; on the one hand, he is personally fascinated with Victorian style, refined luxury and the exquisite taste of the British aristocracy, but on the other, he emphasizes the inhuman flipside of the Victorian era: "Of course I realized, as an African, that Victorian values for me, were very draconian&hellip; The Victorians colonized Afrika. Basically, the Victorians made Africans work to produce a great empire. So Victorian values, to me, were values of repression, values of making me feel inferior."
  </p>
  <p>
    With <em>Scramble for Africa</em> (2003), Shonibare created a particularly impressive tableau illustrating the colonization of the African continent and the imperial cupidity of the European powers. This expansive installation references the Congo Conference which took place in Berlin in 1884&ndash;85 and served as the basis for the colonial partitioning of Africa. A contemporary map of Africa showing the then current state of European occupation is embedded in the middle of the oblong conference table. Seated at it are fourteen headless figures clad in Dutch wax who represent the states participating in the conference and whose "scramble" augurs the so-called race for Africa. By the turn of the century, the participating colonial powers had already divided ninety percent of the territory of Africa among themselves.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Globe Heads, World Views and Aliens
  </h4>
  
  
  
  <p>
    Ever since the late 1990s, Shonibare had been employing exceptionally well-dressed, but headless mannequins to both celebrate and satirise the gallantries, excesses, duels and bucolic leisure activities, in short, the decadent and sumptuous lifestyle of polite society or, alternatively, the quest for knowledge of Europe's educated classes. As guillotined or headless bodies, the figures are robbed of their individuality, more illusion than reality, their skin colour ambiguous&mdash;they are bearers of cultural patterns, instruments of deception, objects of desire and reflect historical experiences and power relations.
  </p>
  <p>
    More recently, a keen interest in cartography and globes has been evident in Shonibare's work. In his reconfigurations of classical sculptures, again featuring the typical Dutch wax batik design, the heads have been replaced with hand-coloured globes. Through this critical gesture in the beautiful guise of classical aesthetics, Shonibare calls for historical multi-perspectivity and a rethinking of space, mobility and cultural identity. The binary division of the world into "we" and "the others", East and West, First and Third World is, after all, based on strict rules of inclusion and exclusion. Moreover, the current geopolitical order is dynamic, and the present-day phrase "the Global South", as an orienting term for the non-hegemonic regions of this world, already represents a reordering of geography, at least in terms of societal and economic dynamics.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>The World at the Time of the Surrealists</em>, a surrealist world map published in the Belgian magazine <em>Vari&eacute;t&eacute;s</em> in 1929, already depicted a world whose familiar contours have gone out of whack. In it certain countries and world regions gain significantly in size, while others have become infinitesimally small. The Soviet Union and China are among the winners, some regions, however, have increased tremendously in size, including the island world of the South Pacific which dominates the centre of the new world map. Alaska and Greenland as well as Mexico and Peru also appear significantly larger, whereas the British Isles have moved to the far western edge of the surreal world image and, shrunk to miniature size, appear smaller than the Hawaiian island chain in the Pacific. The USA have completely disappeared and all that is left of France is Paris, the capital of Surrealism. The playfully curving equatorial line may imply that the map not only counters European reason by offering a different topography, but also that a world of the unconscious, fantasy and imagination is entered. Of central importance, however, is the discrediting of the colonial powers expressed in this subversive map picture.

    World images may be understood as a way of giving form to beliefs through which humans reassure themselves of their place in the world and the world as such. They are based on time- and culture-bound assumptions about the world and manifest themselves in world maps which, while indispensable as tools to visually communicate knowledge, invariably offer mere model-like representations of the earth and as planar projections visualize very different viewpoints and culturally determined perceptual conventions. Shonibare has applied his aesthetic concept of playful hybridity and sly, ironic reframing of cultural and visual stereotypes also to Christian imaginings of the world in the Latin Middle Ages. Commissioned to create work for Hereford Cathedral in West England, he engaged in an in-depth study of the medieval world map located there. The largest and most important surviving universal map of the Middle Ages, it was created for the cathedral around 1300 by Richard de Haldingham. The map is drawn on a single sheet of vellum using black, red, blue or green and gold ink and mounted on an oak panel. The monumental panel shows the earth as a flat, almost circular land mass traversed by rivers and mountain ranges, interspersed with seas and lakes and encircled by a narrow strip of ocean. The map relies on a basic model of representation going back to antiquity: it is a so-called "T-O map," meaning a circular, O-shaped image of the world divided into three parts by bodies of water arranged in the shape of a T. Depicting the ecumenical community as <em>orbis tripartitus</em> with the three continents known at the time, the east-oriented map shows Asia taking up the entire upper semicircle and Europe and Africa the left and right half of the lower semicircle. The Mediterranean, the Don and the Nile are located in the midst of the three continents. Not a travel map, the Hereford map is to be understood as a universal <em>imago mundi</em>, an image of the world. In the centre of the map, and thus of the world, appears Jerusalem, the city from which the history of salvation started out. Strikingly, Europe includes considerably more topographical details, rivers and cities than Asia or Africa. The farther you move away from city-rich Europe and from Asia Minor and North Africa towards the edges, the wilder and more inhospitable the areas and the stronger the animals and human beings you encounter on your graphic hike. You meet legendary peoples, hybrid creatures and curious animals scattered across the entire earth backdrop. India and Ethiopia have the largest share of them: India is home to the sciapods, the pygmies and the giants, the mouthless people, the manticore and the unicorn. North of lndia, in Scythia and neighbouring countries and islands, we encounter humans with horse's hooves, long-eared people and man-eaters. Ethiopia is home to satyrs and fauns, to long-lipped people and ones with faces between the shoulders and on the chest. Some of the wondrous beings must, in fact, have left their ancestral homelands following the discovery of America, for the European conquerors spotted dog-headed creatures (cynocephali) and headless Blemmyes in Latin America as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    The dwellers at the earth's edge shown in the Hereford map refer to numerous fantastic mythical creatures which already preoccupied the ancient authors. Pliny's <em>Natural History</em> and <em>De mirabilibus mundi</em>, a "collection of curiosities" compiled by the late antique polyhistor Solinus who is repeatedly mentioned in the mop, passed down those mythological narrative which forced the church fathers to somehow explain whether the human-like "monsters" could have been part of the divine plan of creation. Saint Augustine was convinced that, provided they were indeed human beings, they had to have descended from Adam and Eve or from Noah's sons as legitimate images of God. The Bible doesn't say anything about how Noah divided the large cake called earth among his sons, but it is assumed that he gave the biggest and best piece to his firstborn son, Shem. The next best one went to Japheth and then all that was left for Ham, who had been cursed by his father, was Africa. In the clerical theory of descent, Ham thus became the progenitor of the Africans, condemned by his father to be his brothers' servant. Thus, the right to oppress and enslave was derived from the miracle of creation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Shonibare's approach to the hybrid creatures and projections of the Hereford Mappa Mundi is, again, that of playful parody. Conveniently, hybridity is essentially the defining feature of those living at the earth's edge. In the catalogue of origin myths and fictitious genealogies, they represent the radical and uncanny Other and thus reflect a massive Occidental ethnocentrism. Shonibare, however, converts this exclusion into elegant exclusivity by celebrating the peculiarity and eccentricity of those figments of the imagination and turns them into aliens fallen from the sky who, equipped with parachutes, float in the air or have already landed. Other-worldly creatures, they are oddballs in decorative surroundings who are appreciated and respected for their peculiarity. The brightly colourful textile works present a cheerful deconstruction and reversal of dark stereotypes. The 2019 exhibition <em>Creatures of the Mappa Mundi</em> shown at Hereford Cathedral is an impressive document of inclusion and emancipation, as Shonibare and his cooperation partners managed to get various local groups of marginalized people involved in the production of the truly wonderful creatures. In this way, a different story is told.

    To Explore: <em>End of Empire</em> by Yinka Shonibare CBE
  </h3>
  <p>
    <em>End of Empire</em> by Yinka Shonibare CBE is a striking work featuring two figures dressed in the artist&rsquo;s signature Dutch wax batik fabric, seated on a Victorian see-saw which slowly pivots in the space. This powerful imagery imitates the shifting points of balance in world politics over the course of World War I and the ensuing colonial fallout. The figures&rsquo; heads are replaced by globes, the maps depicting geopolitical borders as they were drawn in 1917. The bodies are clothed in Victorian suits, their colonial implications skewed by the brightly coloured fabric that, in Shonibare&rsquo;s own words, is &ldquo;Ethnisicing the Aristocracy&rdquo;. This is characteristic of the artist&rsquo;s engaged and critical approach, which uses appealing imagery and light-hearted insertions such as the see-saw to tackle important issues head on. First exhibited in 2016 at Turner Contemporary, Margate, UK, <em>End of Empire</em> was created by Shonibare as part of 14&ndash;18 NOW, a programme of World War I Centenary Art commissions to commemorate the First World War.

    Yinka Shonibare CBE RA was born in 1962 in London, UK. He studied Fine Art at Byam School of Art, London (now Central Saint Martins College) in 1989 and received his MFA from Goldsmiths, University of London in 1991. Shonibare&rsquo;s interdisciplinary practice uses citations of Western art history and literature to question the validity of contemporary cultural and national identities within the context of globalization. His trademark material is the brightly coloured Dutch wax batik fabric he buys in London. This fabric was inspired by Indonesian design, mass-produced by the Dutch and eventually sold to the colonies in West Africa. In the 1960s, the material became a new symbol of African identity and independence.

    To Watch: Wangechi Mutu and the Role of Artists and Art
  </h3>
  <p>
    In this course, we have "read" various art objects and monuments and considered how artists embed art with guidance for viewing and understanding. Art reveals where we came from, where we are at present, and where we are heading. For the penultimate monument of this course, we are examining the world of Wangechi Mutu. <a href="https://www.ted.com/speakers/wangechi_mutu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mutu's TED Talk profile</a> describes the visual artist:
  </p>
  <p>
    "In expansive work that incorporates painting, sculpture, collage, film, installation and performance art, Wangechi Mutu centers on the creation of hybrid creatures that explore themes of power, culture, femininity, colonial history and global consumption. Her art is often made of multiple materials, creating fantastical forms that evoke Afrofuturism and interspecies connections. Born in Nairobi, Kenya, Mutu has held various acclaimed museum and gallery shows around the world, exhibiting in cities including London, Hong Kong, Venice and Brussels. For her exhibition <em>The NewOnes, will free Us</em>, she installed four iconic bronze sculptures in front of The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. A solo show of new work opened at the New Museum in New York in March, 2023."

  <h4>
    Art Term: Afrofuturism
  </h4>
  <p>
    Afrofuturism is a cultural aesthetic that combines science-fiction, history and fantasy to explore the African-American experience and aims to connect those from the black diaspora with their forgotten African ancestry. Refer to the <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/a/afrofuturism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tate's online glossary</a> for more.

    Reading: Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&rsquo;o on What It Means To Be Kenyan
  </h3>
  
  
  
  <p>
    Kọ́l&aacute; T&uacute;bọ̀s&uacute;n explores Kenyan identity with the celebrated author. Originally posted on <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/story/ng%C5%A9g%C4%A9-wa-thiong%E2%80%99o-on-what-it-means-to-be-kenyan/BQWRX_9H-dfvTQ?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Arts &amp; Culture</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&rsquo;o, born in January of 1938, is a foremost Kenyan writer, professor, and language activist &mdash; probably the best known Kenyan writer today. His renown, work, and activism has won him fans and several awards worldwide for his novels, plays, short stories, and essays.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2016, his short story, Ituĩka Rĩa Mũrũngarũ: Kana Kĩrĩa Gĩtũmaga Andũ Mathiĩ Marũngiĩ (The Upright Revolution: Or Why Humans Walk Upright) became the most translated African short story, currently in over fifty languages. It was written originally in Kikuyu, the writer&rsquo;s first language&mdash;which all his stories since the seventies have been written in, before they get translated into other languages.
  </p>
  <p>
    I myself have translated the story into Yor&ugrave;b&aacute;, having met the writer at a literary festival in Abẹ́&ograve;kuta, Nigeria, in 2016. I have since collaborated with him on other projects enough to call him a mentor, father-figure, and friend. In this interview, I talk to him important cultural issues, his career, and Kenya, his native land.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>How would you describe "the people of Kenya" to someone who has never met them or even heard about the country?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Beautiful. Talented. Hardworking. Enterprising. The country is a vibrant space of the different cultural streams of African, Asian, and European origins. Its landscape and history have become part of the global imagination.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>What does "identity" mean to you?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Identity is an ever changing unity of difference and sameness; particularity and universality. Identity is the imagined container of multitudes. I am Gĩkũyũ, meaning I share a certain history with all who call themselves Gĩkũyũ, but I am also Kenyan, meaning I share a geographic and historical space with all other Kenyans. I am African. I am black. I&rsquo;m a citizen of the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>In which way has the notion of your identity changed over the years?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    It follows from the above that notions of identity, especially the name we give to it, change all the time. The particulars of experience change but the universal element of being, bound up in the particular, remains. Particularity is the form of being. Universality is the commonality of being. Identity is their unity.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>How has being part of the Kikuyu community influenced your life and outlook?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    I have shared my story in my memoirs: Dreams in a Time of War; In the House of the Interpreter; Birth of a Dreamweaver, and Wrestling with the Devil. I am still writing it through my actions. I was born in a home of four mothers, one father, and several siblings. My biological mother, Wanjikũ, is the most important influence on my life. She always wanted to know if I had tried my best, in whatever I did. But I am also a product of Gikuyu history and culture.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Today, 44 communities are officially registered by the Kenyan government and there are conversations about adding more to the list. Is there an object or a location that you consider to be a symbol of all these communities coming together?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    We are a people just like any other peoples of our globe. But as Kenyan peoples, we share a common history of struggle against colonialism. I grew up within the wider history of resistance to British colonial state, which, led by the Kenya Land and Freedom Army (the one the British misnamed Mau Mau) helped bring about our Independence in 1963. We share aspiration for a Kenya in which every child has access to adequate food, housing, education, and health.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>How would you define the identity of Kenya as a nation today?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    The Kenyan identity is a work in progress. We struggle to be the best that Kenya can be. For this, we have to continue to struggle to secure our economic, political, and cultural base, all threatened by largely Western financial, and other, corporations. We have to continue to struggle against the gross social and income inequalities within our own country.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>What is your favourite saying in any Kenyan language and why?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Gũtirĩ ũtukũ ũtakĩa: &ldquo;There is no night so long that will not see the light of dawn.&rdquo; My mother, Wanjikũ, used to tell me this proverb. In times of challenges and adversity, I always recall the saying to instill in me resistance against succumbing to the negative. The saying is an expression of optimism.

    To Analyze and Read: <em>MamaRay</em> (2020)
  </h3>
  <p>
    Take some time to closely look at and analyze Wangechi Mutu's <em>MamaRay</em> sculpture. What details do you notice first and why? Which angle(s) are you supposed to engage and interact with the sculpture? How did the Mutu use the elements of art and principles of design within the sculpture? After spending some time analyzing <em>MamaRay</em>, read the following excerpt from Margot Norton et al., <em>Wangechi Mutu: Intertwined</em> (London: Phaidon Press Limited, 2023).
