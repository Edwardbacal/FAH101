<h3>
  Introduction: Tā Moko
</h3>



<p>
  The native people of New Zealand, called the Māori, are known around the world for their tattooing. Although their tattoos do not cover as much of the body as many South Pacific people such as the Samoans, the Māori developed their own unusual style of tattooing, covering the face and the buttocks. First described by Captain James Cook in 1769, Māori tattooing remains one of the most unique and beautiful of all tattoo traditions.
</p>
<p>
  The moko is the curvilinear facia tattoo worn by Māori men and women as a sign of status as well as affiliation, and only high-status Māori and warriors at one time were tattooed. Women's tattoos were originally limited to the lips and sometimes other parts of the body or forehead; in the 19th century, the spiral chin tattoo was developed. Men could wear the moko, or, if they had their bodies tattooed, the tattoo extended over the area between the waist and the knees, primarily covering the buttocks.
</p>
<p>
  The tattoo design was first drawn onto the skin, and then carved into the skin with a tool known as <em>uhi whaka tataramoa</em>, which operated much like wood carving to which it can be related both in design and technique. The tattooist, who was always a man, literally carved the design into the skin. After cutting the skin, pigment was rubbed into the wound.
</p>
<p>
  The procedure was said to be incredibly painful, and caused so much facial swelling that, after tattooing, the person could not eat normally, and had to be fed liquids through a funnel. During the lengthy tattoo, as well, the tattooed person could receive liquid food through the tunnel, thus keeping the contaminating food from the wounds. A woman's moko, which covered the chin and lips, could take one or two days to complete. A man's moko, which covered the whole face, was done in several stages over several years and was an important rite of passage for a Māori man; without the moko, the man was said to not be a complete person.
</p>
<p>
  Unlike tattoos in Polynesia and elsewhere, which have designs that are worn by everyone of the same tribe, clan, or tank, Māori tattoos were totally individual. While they did indicate a man's social and kinship position, marital status, and other information, each moko was like a fingerprint, and no two were alike. Māori chiefs even used drawings of their moko as their signature in the 19th century. Because the moko, in part, signified rank, different designs on both men and women could be read as relating to their family status, and each of the Māori social ranks carried different designs. In addition, some women who, due to their genealogical connections, were extremely high status, could wear part of the male moko.
</p>
<p>
  As in Marquesan tattooing, Māori facial designs were divided into four zones (left forehead, right forehead, left lower face, and right lower face) and these further divided, giving an overall symmetry to the design. The right side of the face conveyed information about the father's rank, tribal affiliations, and position. The left side of a face, on the other hand, gave information about the mother's rank, tribal affiliations, and position. Each side of the face is also subdivided into eight sections, which contain information about rank, position in life, tribal identification, lineage, and more personal information, including occupation or skill.
</p>
<p>
  Tattooing styles varied from tribe to tribe and region to region, as well as love time. Cook, for example, noted that the men on one side of an inlet were tattooed all over their faces, whereas the men on the other side of the inlet were only tattooed on the lips. He also noted that some moko did not include the forehead but only extended from the chin to the eyes. Also, Cook's men noted that there was at least one man at that time who had straight vertical lines tattooed on his face, combined with spirals, as well as two elderly men with horizontal lines across their face. Tattoos of this sort were never again seen on subsequent visits. And by the 19th century, different styles of moko were seen, including both the classic curvilinear styles as well as vertical and horizontal parallel lines.
</p>
<p>
  The Māori had a tradition of preserving the tattooed heads of deceased persons of nobility in order, it was presumed, to keep alive the memory of the dead. The heads were also held to be sacred, in that they continued to possess the deceased's <em>mana</em>, or magical quality. But in 1770, just a year after initial contact, Europeans became interested in these tattooed heads, and initiated a heads-for-weapons trade that lasted until 1831, when it was banned by the colonial authorities.
</p>
<p>
  The first dried head to be possessed by a European was acquired on January 20, 1770. It was brought by Joseph Banks, who was with Cook's expedition as a naturalist, and was one of four brought to board the Endeavour for inspection. It was the head of a tattooed youth of 14 or 15, who had been killed by a blow to the head.
</p>
<p>
  The trade became especially scandalous because during the tribal wars of the 1820s, when European demand for the heads was at an all time high, war captives and slaves were probably tattooed, killed, and their decapitated heads sold to European traders. As the traffic in heads escalated, the Māori stopped preserving the heads of their friends, so that they wouldn't fall into the hands of the Europeans. Evidently, it also became dangerous to even wear a moko, as one could be killed at any time and have one's head sold to traders. By the end of the head trade in the 1830s, the moko was dying out, due to missionary activity.
</p>
<p>
  Like Hawaiian and Tahitian tattooing, Māori tattooing was also influenced by European contact. On Cook's first visit to New Zealand, the ship artist, Sydney Parkinson, drew pictures of the moko, exposing Europeans for the first time to Māori and their art, and, inciting the interest in tattooed heads that would follow. Tattoo techniques changed as well as a result of contact. Originally, the Māori applied their wood carving techniques to tattooing, literally carving the skin and rubbing ink into the open wounds. After European contact, sailors brought metal to the Māori, enabling them to adopt the puncture method found in the parts of Polynesia.
</p>
<p>
  After European contact, the moko became associated with Māori culture as a way for the native people of New Zealand to distinguish themselves from the Europeans who had settled there, but by 1840, due to missionary activity, the male moko was falling out of fashion. It was revived briefly during the wars against Europe from 1864 to 1868, but by the turn of the century, there were only a handful of tattooed Māori alive. Ironically, it was during the period in which the male moko was declining that the female chin moko was gaining in popularity as a symbol of identity.
</p>
<p>
  Since the late 20th century, some Māori have begun wearing <em>tā moko</em> again as an assertion of their cultural identity. A few Māori tattoo artists are reviving traditional methods of applying tā moko, but most use electric machines.

<h3>
  Reading: New Zealand through the Eyes of a Czech Artist
</h3>
<p>
  At the turn of the twentieth century, hundreds of people visited a small upstairs gallery on Queen Street in Auckland to view portraits of Māori by the artist Gottfried Lindauer. Lindauer, a migrant from Bohemia (now part of the Czech Republic) who arrived in New Zealand in 1874, began exhibiting portraits of Māori subjects in 1876. The inscriptions left by Māori visitors in the Queen Street gallery's visitors' books attest to their strong interest in the images of their leaders, <em>whānau</em> (family) and <em>tipuna</em> (ancestor). Apart from being the subjects of Lindauer's portraits, Māori commissioned painted portraits of their <em>tipuna</em>, and these portraits were exhibited by <em>hapū</em> (sub-tribe, tribal group), <em>whānau</em> (family) and <em>iwi in marae</em> (open space in front of a tribal meetinghouse) and at <em>tangihanga</em> (funeral ceremony) as part of <em>whānau taonga</em> (family treasured possession), alongside photographs which had become the conventional mode of representation. The portraits are today living ancestors to <em>uri whakaheke</em> (descendants) of the sitters and often the only surviving images of ancestors.
</p>
<p>
  Lindauer was an artist who helped form public relationships with Māori, and Māori engaged with Lindauer as an artist. Gottfried Lindauer, born a citizen of the Austrian empire in 1839, came to be called Rinitana by the Ngāti Hikairo ki Tongariro people of Ngāti Tūwharetoa and his paintings are meaningful to succeeding generations of New Zealanders.
</p>
<p>
  Lindauer came from a modernising Europe. His hometown Pilsen&mdash;encircled by Germany to the west and north, Poland to the northeast, Moravia to the east and Austria to the south&mdash;was at the centre of the wealth-producing heartland of the Austrian empire. Born into a middle-class Christian background, Lindauer undertook private tuition, becoming an academic painter with a focus on religious commissions and portraits. After being conscripted for a second time to serve in the Austrian Army, Lindauer departed Bohemia via Hamburg on board the <em>Reichstag</em>, with a plan for a short-term stay in New Sealand. He arrived in Wellington on 6 August 1874 and made Aotearoa New Zealand his permanent home.

<h4>
  Ancestor portraits
</h4>
<p>
  We all know portraits can be of ancestors, but can a portrait be an ancestor?
</p>
<p>
  In <em>Te Ao Māori</em>, the Māori world, they can. Paintings like this one&mdash;and even photographs&mdash;do two important things. They record likenesses and bring ancestral presence into the world of the living. In other words, this portrait is not merely a representation of Tāmati Wāka Nene, it can be an embodiment of him. Portraits and other <em>taonga tuku iho</em> (treasures passed down from the ancestors) are treated with great care and reverence. After a person has died their portrait may be hung on the walls of family homes and in the wharenui (the central building of a community center), to be spoken to, wept over, and cherished by people with genealogical connections to them. Even when portraits like this one, kept in the collection of the Auckland Art Gallery, are absent from their families, the stories woven around them keep them alive and present. Auckland Art Gallery acknowledges these living links through its relationships with descendants of those whose portraits it cares for. The Gallery seeks their advice when asked for permission to reproduce such portraits. This portrait has been published in the Google Arts &amp; Culture project, which is why we can look at it here.
</p>
<h4>
  Tāmati Wāka Nene
</h4>
<p>
  Māori are the Indigenous people of New Zealand/Aotearoa. The subject of this portrait, Tāmati Wāka Nene, was a <em>Rangatira</em> or chief of the Ngāti Hao people in Hokianga, of the Ngāpuhi iwi or tribe, and an important war leader. He was probably born in the 1780s, and died in 1871. He lived through a time of rapid change in New Zealand, when the first British missionaries and settler-colonists were arriving and changing the Māori world forever. An astute leader and businessman, Nene exemplified the types of changes that were occurring when he converted to the faith and was baptised in 1839, choosing to be named Tāmati Wāka after Thomas Walker, who was an English merchant patron of the Church Missionary Society. He was revered throughout his life as a man with great mana or personal efficacy.
</p>
<p>
  In his portrait, Nene wears a <em>kahu kiwi</em>, a fine cloak covered in kiwi feathers, and an earring of greenstone or pounamu. Both of these are prestigious <em>taonga</em> or treasures. He is holding a hand weapon known as a <em>tewhatewha</em>, which has feathers adorning its blade and a finely carved hand grip with an abalone or paua eye. All of these mark him as man of mana or personal efficacy and status. But perhaps the most striking feature for an international audience is his intricate facial tattoo, called <em>moko</em>.
</p>





<h4>
  Gottfried Lindauer and his patron
</h4>
<p>
  Lindauer was a Czech artist who arrived in New Zealand in 1873 after a decade of painting professionally in Europe. He had studied at the Academy of Fine Art in Vienna from 1855 to 1861, and learned painting techniques rooted in Renaissance naturalism. When he left the Academy he began working as a portrait painter, and established his own portrait studio in 1864. Just ten years later he arrived in New Zealand and quickly became acquainted with a man called Henry Partridge, who became his patron. Partridge commissioned Lindauer to paint portraits of well-known Māori, and three years later, in 1877, Lindauer held an exhibition in Wellington. The exhibition was important because it demonstrated Lindauer&rsquo;s abilities and he was soon being commissioned by Māori chiefs to paint their portraits. Lindauer took different approaches to his commissions depending on who was paying. He tended to paint well-known Māori in Māori clothing for European purchasers, but painted unknown Māori in everyday European clothing when commissioned by their families to do so. His paintings are realistic, convincingly three-dimensional, and play beautifully with the contrast between light and shadow, causing his subjects to glow against their dark backgrounds. As his patron, Partridge amassed a large collection of portraits as well as large scale depictions that re-enacted Māori ways of life that were thought to be disappearing. In 1915, Partridge gave his collection of 62 portraits to the Auckland Art Gallery&mdash;the largest collection of Lindauer paintings in the world.
</p>


<h4>
  Painting Tāmati Wāka Nene
</h4>
<p>
  If you&rsquo;ve been paying attention to dates you will have noticed that Nene died in 1871 but Lindauer didn&rsquo;t arrive in New Zealand until 1873, and didn&rsquo;t paint his portrait until 1890. It is likely that Lindauer based this portrait on a photograph taken by John Crombie, who had been commissioned to produce 12 photographic portraits of Māori chiefs for <em>The Illustrated London News</em>. There are several other photographs of Nene, and in 1934 Charles F. Goldie&mdash;another famous portrayer of Māori&mdash;painted yet another portrait of him from a photograph. So Nene didn&rsquo;t sit for either of his famous painted portraits, but clearly sat for photographic portraits in the later years of his life. These were becoming more common by 1870, due to developments in photographic methods that made the whole process easier and cheaper. Many Māori had their portraits taken photographically and produced as a carte-de-visite, roughly the size of a playing card, and some had larger, postcard-sized images made, called cabinet portraits. Lindauer is thought to have used a device called an epidiascope to enlarge and project small photographs such as these so he could paint them.
</p>
<p>
  Lindauer didn&rsquo;t make many sketches. He worked straight onto stretched canvas, outlining his subjects in pencil over a white background before applying translucent paints and glazes. Through the thinly painted surface of some of his works you can still see traces of pencil lines that may be evidence of his practice of outlining projected images. But Lindauer wasn&rsquo;t simply copying photographs. In the 1870s, color photography had yet to be invented&mdash;Lindauer was working from black and white images and reimagining them in color. Moreover, sometimes he dressed his sitters&mdash;and those he painted from photos&mdash;in borrowed garments and adorned them with taonga that were not necessarily theirs. Thus some of his works contain artistic interventions rather than being entirely documentary.

<h3>
  What is a compare and contrast analysis?
</h3>
<p>
  A distinctive kind of art-history question is the comparison (compare and contrast). In a compare and contrast, two slides are shown and students are asked to compare and contrast the images&mdash;to discuss the similarities and differences between them. This kind of question may ask you to discuss two images within a culture or period, or images across cultures or periods.
</p>
<p>
  Your instructor may provide a specific question to answer, or you may have to determine the important issues raised by the juxtaposition of the two images. It&rsquo;s important to spend time thinking and outlining your answer before you begin to write, especially when there is no question provided. You want to make sure that you're focusing on the central issue presented by the pairing of the two images. Pairings aren't random&mdash;usually your instructor is prompting you to discuss an important theme or issue in the course.
</p>
<p>
  A mistake a lot of students make in comparisons is simply describing one image and then the other without ever relating the two. Make sure you're discussing the similarities and differences between them. Words like "similarly," "unlike," "both," "in contrast," and "while" are good clues that you're developing a strong comparative essay. As with a thematic essay, the conclusion should summarize your argument and present any final thoughts.

<h4>
  Recap: What is the goal of a compare and contrast analysis?
</h4>
<p>
  The goal of a compare and contrast analysis is to make a point, argue a thesis. You are not merely making two lists. You will introduce the comparison with a thesis sentence.

<h3>
  Compare and Contrast Analysis Organization
</h3>
<p>
  We can call the two ways of organizing a compare and contrast <strong>block-by-block</strong> (or lumping) and <strong>point-by-point</strong> (or splitting).
</p>
<p>
  Whether organizing by lumping or by splitting will depend largely on your purpose and on the complexity of the material. Lumping is often used for long, complex comparisons, if for no other reason than to avoid the ping-pong effect, but no hard-and-fast rule covers all cases here. When you offer an extended comparison, it is advisable to begin by indicating your focus, that is, by defining the main issue or problem and also by indicating what your principle of organization will be in the introduction.
</p>
<p>
  The University of Toronto Writing Centre offers a helpful resource on the <a href="https://advice.writing.utoronto.ca/types-of-writing/comparative-essay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comparative essay</a>.
</p>
<h4>
  Block-by-Block (Lumping)
</h4>
<p>
  When you compare block-by-block, you say what you have to say about one artwork in a block or lump, and then you go on to discuss the second artwork, in another block or lump.
</p>
<p>
  For example, a lumping structure would be as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Thesis about the Buddha and the bodhisattva
  </li>
  <li>
    The Buddha (posture, folds of garments, inner nature)
  </li>
  <li>
    The bodhisattva (posture, folds of garments, inner nature)
  </li>
  <li>
    The Buddha and the bodhisattva (synthesis)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you lump, do not simply comment first on X and then on Y.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Let your reader know where you are going, probably by means of an introductory sentence.
  </li>
  <li>
    Don't be afraid in the second half to remind the reader of the first half. It is legitimate, even desirable, to connect the second half of the comparison (chiefly concerned with Y) to the first half (chiefly concerned with X). Thus, you will probably say things like "Unlike X, Y show&hellip;" or "Although Y superficially resembles X in such-and-such, when looked at closely Y shows&hellip;" In short, a comparison organized by lumping will not break into two separate halves if the second half develops by reminding the reader how it differs from the first half.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>
  Point-by-Point (Splitting)
</h4>
<p>
  When you compare point-by-point, however, you split up your discussion of each work, more or less interweaving your comments on the two things being compared, perhaps in alternating paragraphs, or even in alternating sentences.
</p>
<p>
  For example, a splitting structure would be as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Thesis about the Buddha and the bodhisattva
  </li>
  <li>
    The Buddha (posture)
  </li>
  <li>
    The bodhisattva (posture)
  </li>
  <li>
    The Buddha (garments)
  </li>
  <li>
    The bodhisattva (garments)
  </li>
  <li>
    The Buddha and the bodhisattva (synthesis)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Splitting is well suited to short essays or for occasional use within longer essays, but if it is relentlessly used as the organizing principle of a longer essay, it is likely to produce a ping-pong effect. The essay may not come into focus&mdash;the reader may not grasp the point&mdash;until the writer stands back from the seven-layer cake and announces, in the concluding paragraph, that the odd layers taste better.
</p>
<p>
  In your preparatory thinking, splitting probably will help you to get certain characteristics clear in your mind, but you must come to some conclusions about what these add up to before writing the final version. The final version should not duplicate the preliminary thought processes; rather, since the point of a comparison is to make a point, it should be organized so as to make the point clearly and effectively.
</p>
<p>
  If you split, in rereading your draft:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Ask yourself if your imagined reader can keep up with the back-and-forth movement. Make sure (perhaps by a summary sentence at the end) that the larger picture is not obscured by the zigzagging.
  </li>
  <li>
    Don't leave any loose ends. Make sure that if you call attention to points 1, 2, and 3 in X, you mention all of them (not just 1 and 2) in Y.

<h3>
  Common Writing Pitfalls
</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Writing takes practice.</strong> You can't become a good writer without writing&mdash;a lot. Learning how to write in the style of a particular academic discipline isn't easy, because each discipline has its own distinctive way of researching, structuring arguments, and presenting evidence. Writing as an art historian will teach you to look carefully (through close looking and reading), argue logically (e.g., through a compare and contrast analysis), and think originally. Remember that in the end all writing, not just fiction or poetry, is a creative process.
</p>
<caption>Table: Common Pitfalls of Art-History Writing</caption>


<p>Issue</p>
<p>Comments</p>



<li>
  Very long paragraphs (a full page or longer)
</li>
<li>
  Usually this means the arguments are muddled and you are trying to make more than one point at a time. You can probably restructure a very long paragraph as two or more paragraphs.
</li>



<li>
  Very short paragraphs (one or two sentences)
</li>
<li>
  This means either that your thoughts are not fully developed and you need to expand that paragraph, or that the material should be integrated into the paper elsewhere.
</li>



<li>
  Unfocused paragraphs
</li>
<li>
  Make sure each paragraph has a point to make and is not just a jumbled collection of miscellaneous observations that don't seem to fit anywhere else. Does the paragraph have a topic sentence? Does each sentence in the paragraph support and develop that idea? If not, then edit.
</li>



<li>
  Long, convoluted sentences
</li>
<li>
  Douglas Fraser, who taught art history at Columbia University, used to tell his students, "Take your favourite sentence and rewrite it, the simple way."
</li>



<li>
  Strings of prepositional phrases
</li>
<li>
  These are especially difficult to avoid in a formal analysis. For example: (Awkward) The family sits around a table with flowers in a vase on top of it. (Better) The family sits around a table decorated with a flower-filled vase.
</li>



<li>
  Expletive constructions ("there is," "it is")
</li>
<li>
  They bulk up sentences and are imprecise, so watch out for them in the editing process. For example: (Awkward) It was the last image in the manuscript that was the most striking. (Better) The last image in the manuscript was the most striking.
</li>



<li>
  Passive voice
</li>
<li>
  Active verbs are more forceful and expressive than passive verbs. A paragraph full of passive verbs sounds stilted and monotonous. For example: (Passive) The fresco was painted by Michelangelo. (Active) Michelangelo painted the fresco.
</li>



<li>
  Strong verbs
</li>
<li>
  Make sure your verbs are active and precise. Avoid, when possible, bland verbs like "is," "has," and "goes." Be sure to streamline your verbs (for example, replace "has an affect on" with "affects").
</li>



<li>
  Verb tenses
</li>
<li>
  Use consistent and correct tenses throughout your paper. This does not mean that the verbs will all be in one tense. Art historians typically use the present tense to describe visual or physical aspects of an artwork: "the Buddha sits in a yogic posture," "the columns support the pediment." Use the past tense to discuss the actions and thoughts of a deceased artist: "Picasso lived in Paris."
</li>



<li>
  "Five-dollar" words
</li>
<li>
  Explain your ideas in your own way, avoiding flowery expressions and long, technical, or unusual "five-dollar'' words if you aren't sure what they mean. At the same time, don't be afraid to use terms that help you explain your argument with precision&mdash;if you know how to use "<em>contrapposto</em>" or "<em>impasto</em>'' correctly, then do.

  How do I start writing a compare and contrast analysis?
</h3>
<p>
  Remember how Briana Zavadil White from the National Portrait Gallery guided us through the compare and contrast of two portraits of Pocahontas? Review the "<a href="https://youtu.be/oKc3r5fmCQY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teacher Lesson: Compare &amp; Contrast</a>" video (15:01) again to help you begin your compare and contrast analysis. Pay attention to the brainstorming process and what initial and follow-up questions were asked.
</p>
<p>

<h4>
  Developing a List of Similarities and Differences
</h4>
<p>
  The first step in writing a compare and contrast analysis is developing a list of similarities and differences. I often brainstorm the similarities and differences by drawing a Venn diagram or using a table (refer to examples on the <a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/comparing-and-contrasting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Writing Center website</a>).
</p>
<p>
  In our course, we are comparing the two objects (refer to the "<a href="#writing">Writing Your Compare and Contrast Analysis Paper</a>" section below). Use the following questions to help you start developing a list of similarities and differences:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    What is the topic of each object? What details are included in each object?
  </li>
  <li>
    How do the formal elements guide the viewing experience?
  </li>
  <li>
    What are the materials and sizes of each object?
  </li>
  <li>
    What are the contexts (if known) of each object? (Recall the 5Ws and 1H)
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>
  Developing a Thesis
</h4>
<p>
  After developing a list of similarities and differences, determine what is interesting, important, and relevant in the context of the course/assignment. Identify how the similarities and differences create an argument about the two paintings. Do the similarities outweigh the differences and vice versa? The University of Toronto Writing Centre offers a helpful resource on <a href="https://advice.writing.utoronto.ca/planning/thesis-statements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using thesis statements</a>.

<h3>
  Writing Your Compare and Contrast Analysis Paper</strong><strong>
    
  </h3>
  <p>
    Make sure you proofread your papers to adhere to the information listed above, as well as incorrect grammar, spelling, punctuation, and other errors. In addition, make sure your paper includes a thesis statement. Your grade will reflect your ability to follow these guidelines. Refer to the rubric on the assignment page for grading guidelines.
  </p>
  <p>
    For FAH101H1F, your compare and contrast analysis paper will primarily focus on the formal elements of the two objects. Review Week 3's skills pages for a recap of the formal elements and formal analysis. The first of your two objects is the object that you have already sketched, annotated, and formally analyzed. The second object is selected from the weekly "monuments." Refer to the list provided on the assignment page.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the first paragraph, called the introduction, you will include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      the name of the artist (if known), title (which is <em>italicized</em> every time you use the title in your paper), date, and medium (if known) for both objects you are comparing and contrasting
    </li>
    <li>
      what you think is the subject of each object
    </li>
    <li>
      thesis statement (usually the last line or so of your first paragraph)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    From that point, the rest of the compare and contrast analysis should include not only a description of each object but especially those details of the work that have led you to come to your thesis. The goal of a compare and contrast analysis is to make a point, argue a thesis. You are not merely making two lists. You are relating the two objects to one another and addressing questions such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Why should these two objects be compared and contrasted?
    </li>
    <li>
      How does comparing and contrasting the two objects reveal additional insights about each object?
    </li>
    <li>
      Why has each artist used formal elements in a particular way?
    </li>
    <li>
      How has such strategies uses guided and affected your viewing experience?
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    As with your formal analysis, the conclusion should summarize your argument (i.e., a restatement of your thesis) and present any final thoughts.

</p>
<h3>
  Reading: Tsuu T'ina (Sarcee)
</h3>



<p>
  The Tsuu T&rsquo;ina (Sarcee) are a Dene (or Athabaskan) First Nation whose reserve borders the southwestern city limits of Calgary, Alberta. The name "Sarcee" is believed to have originated from a Siksik&aacute;&iacute;&rsquo;powahsin (Blackfoot language) word meaning boldness and hardiness. The Sarcee people call themselves Tsuu T&rsquo;ina (also Tsuut'ina and Ts&uacute;&ugrave;t'&iacute;n&agrave;), translated literally as "many people" or "every one (in the Nation)."
</p>
<h4>
  Traditional Territory
</h4>
<p>
  According to oral tradition, the Tsuu T&rsquo;ina split from a northern nation, probably the Dane-zaa, and moved to the plains, where they have maintained close contact with the Siksika, Cree and Stoney. Their acculturation to the plains culture distinguishes them from other northern Dene people, but they have retained their language, often known as Sarcee.
</p>
<p>
  Today, Tsuu&rsquo;tina territory is in southern Alberta, bordering the southwestern city limits of Calgary. In 1877, well-known leader Chief Bull&rsquo;s Head reluctantly signed Treaty 7, which created the 280 km2 reserve on which the Tsuu T&rsquo;ina now live.

</p>
<p>
  Born around 1833, Chief Bull&rsquo;s Head belonged to the Tsuu T&rsquo;ina tribe, formerly called the Sarcee. After mid-century, when inter-tribal warfare reached high intensity, Bull&rsquo;s Head became the leading warrior of his tribe. His war deeds are recorded on the painted buffalo hide displayed behind you. After his brother died in battle in 1865, Bull&rsquo;s Head succeeded him as chief of the tribe and led the Tsuu T&rsquo;ina until his death in 1911.
</p>
<p>
  In 1877 Bull&rsquo;s Head signed Treaty No. 7 with the Dominion of Canada on behalf of his people, who numbered 255. Several years later, the Tsuu T&rsquo;ina settled on a reserve twelve kilometers from the center of present day Calgary. Despite devastating social and health problems, and great pressure to sell parts of their land, Bull&rsquo;s Head ably led the Tsuu T&rsquo;ina into the twentieth century united as a people and with their reserve intact.
</p>

<h4>
  Traditional Life
</h4>
<p>
  Prior to life on the reserve, the Tsuu T&rsquo;ina camped in tipis and hunted along the edge of the forest during the winter. During the summer, all bands met in the open prairie to hunt bison, collect berries and engage in ceremonies, dances and festivals.
</p>
<p>
  When anthropologist Diamond Jenness visited the Tsuu T&rsquo;ina reserve in 1921, the nation consisted of five bands: Big Plumes, Crow Childs, Crow Chiefs, Old Sarcees and Many Horses. Before they were confined to the reserve, each band was led by a chief. Today, the band is governed by an elected chief and counsellors.
</p>


<h4>
  Language
</h4>
<p>
  The Tsuu T&rsquo;ina language (often known as Sarcee) is an Athabaskan/Dene language of northern Canada. It is considered endangered; according to the 2016 Statistics Canada census, only 150 people identify having knowledge of Sarcee. Various institutions and community programs are working to preserve and protect the language. In 2011, the University of Calgary developed a program in association with the Tsuu T'ina Gunaha Institute to help revive the language.

</p>
<h4>
  Population
</h4>
<p>
  From 1857 to 1860, explorer Captain John Palliser estimated the Tsuu T&rsquo;ina population at 1,400 during his scientific expedition of western Canada. Epidemics of smallpox (1837), scarlet fever (1864) and other diseases, as well as wars, reduced their population to 450 by the time they settled on the reserve in 1881. By 1924, the Tsuu T&rsquo;ina population had decreased to about 160.
</p>
<p>
  According to Statistics Canada, between the years 1996 and 2006, the Indigenous population in Canada grew by approximately 45 per cent. This higher growth rate can be contributed to higher fertility rates and an increasing tendency for people to identify as Indigenous. As of 2020, the Government of Canada counted 2,439 registered members of Tsuu T&rsquo;ina Nation.
</p>
<h4>
  History
</h4>
<p>
  With colonization and increased white settlement, traditional ways of life for the Tsuu T&rsquo;ina were forever altered. On 22 September 1877, the Tsuu T&rsquo;ina and some other Indigenous nations signed Treaty 7, which created various reserves. At the time, the millions of bison that had once roamed the North American plains&mdash;and on which various Indigenous nations relied on for food&mdash;had disappeared. For Indigenous people like the Tsuu T&rsquo;ina, treaties offered a way to survive; for the Canadian government, treaties were a way of enabling westward settlement and expansion.
</p>
<p>
  Like many other Indigenous peoples in Canada, the Tsuu T&rsquo;ina have had their society and culture threatened by colonial policies and practices of assimilation, including the Indian Act, residential schools, reserves and the pass system. These have had historic and ongoing impacts on generations of Indigenous peoples. The final reports of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women speak to ongoing work of reconciliation.
</p>
<h4>
  Culture and Beliefs
</h4>
<p>
  Historically, the Tsuu T&rsquo;ina believed in supernatural power that could be obtained through a vision or dream and was enshrined in a tipi painting or medicine object, such as a beaver bundle or pipe bundle. The quest for supernatural power and the attainment of certain character traits, such as bravery for men and chastity for women, were highly valued. In traditional Tsuu T&rsquo;ina culture, the family usually arranged marriages, and the gifts exchanged reflected family status.
</p>
<p>
  In recent years, many Tsuu T&rsquo;ina are Anglican or Catholic, but they observe traditional cultural ceremonies and feasts, such as the Beaver Bundle ceremony and the Medicine Pipe ceremony, the Rock Pile Feast and the Christmas Powwow in the winter.
</p>
<p>
  The Tsuu T&rsquo;ina also host annual celebrations that include a rodeo, handgames, and golf tournament.
</p>
<h4>
  Contemporary Life
</h4>
<p>
  Today, the Tsuu T&rsquo;ina are active in modern economic sectors, such as cattle raising and real estate, but efforts are being made to revive the traditional culture and lifestyle.
</p>
<p>
  There are also band-operated schools on the reserve which most children attend, while some still go to public or separate schools in Calgary.
</p>
<p>
  In 2020, Costco opened a new store on Tsuut'ina territory. This is the first Costco in North America that is located on a First Nation.

<h3>
  To Analyze and Read: <em>Painted Buffalo Robe</em> (c. 1908)
</h3>

<p>
  Take some time to closely look at and analyze Two Gun's (Sarcee) <em>Painted Buffalo Robe</em>. How do you read the robe? Where do you start and what section do you read next? What details do you notice first and why? How did Two Gun's (Sarcee) use the elements of art and principles of design within the robe? After spending some time analyzing the <em>Painted Buffalo Robe</em>, read the following excerpt from the Royal Ontario Museum's wall panels.

</p>




<h4>
  War Record Robes
</h4>
<p>
  During much of the 19th century, Great Plains life was marked by intense inter-tribal warfare. Most Plain tribes adopted systems to reward individual war exploits. The successful warrior won the right to publicly display pictorial accounts of his deeds on his robe.
</p>
<p>
  War record robes were probably made by all the Plains peoples, with some variation in tribal style. Usually made of buffalo hide, the robes would &ldquo;show off&rdquo; single war events or connected series of events, with little regard for chronological order.
</p>
<p>
  Only a dozen or so war record robes survive from the early 19th century. Most known examples were painter later, after the warfare ended.
</p>


<h4>
  Bull&rsquo;s Head Robe
</h4>
<p>
  In 1908 the artist, Edmund Morris, brought a buffalo hide formerly used as carriage robe from Toronto to the Sarcee Reserve. He commissioned the reserve Interpreter and Farm Instructor, George Hodgson, to have Bull&rsquo;s Head&rsquo;s war history painted on it. Bull&rsquo;s Head described his deeds in Sarcee to Two Guns who executed the painting. Young Charlie Crow Chief, among the first graduates of the reserve school, probably translated Bull&rsquo;s Head&rsquo;s words into English. Hodgson&rsquo;s daughters transcribed the text, quoted in part below. This text is today preserved in Morris' archival papers.
</p>
<p>
  Two Guns was born around 1861, too young to have been a warrior. Yet his painting vividly evokes the high drama of Plains Indian warfare. He recorded six of Bull&rsquo;s Head&rsquo;s exploits, along with a tally of the horses, weapons and scalps taken from the enemy. Unlike more traditional war exploit painting thick lines were drawn to distinguish the events, and English names and numbers were inscribed as a key to the written explanations. He painted the enemy Crees in black and blue, with the Tsuu T&rsquo;ina in red and green.
</p>

<p>
  In the same year 1860, one winter day, at Battle River near Dried Meat Lake, the Sarcees had driven a large band of Buffaloes into a &ldquo;Buffalo Pawn&rdquo; [pound]. (A Buffalo Pawn is an enclosure built of logs. Built by the Indians for capturing Buffalo.) And while butchering the animals they had just killed, aided by the women and children a party of Crees surrounded them. In an instant they were prepared for fight. Many managed to reach the camp, which was near by Bull&rsquo;s Head who had reached his tepee, shot and killed one of the enemy.
</p>
<p>
  The Crees were defeated and fled. Four of the Sarcee braves were killed.
</p>

<p>
  A few weeks after Little Chief [Bull&rsquo;s Head&rsquo;s brother] was skilled while the Sarcees were camping at Battle River some of their horses were stolen.
</p>
<p>
  Suspecting where their horses were taken to, Bull&rsquo;s Head gathered a few men and rode away.
</p>
<p>
  They soon came upon a party of Crees building a fort. One of the Crees came to meet them asking to be friends, but Bull&rsquo;s Head who had not forgotten his brother&rsquo;s death jumped from his horse and sprang to the Cree with the intention of killing him but ended by only taking his gun and giving it to &ldquo;Heaven Fire.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
  In the summer of 1866 a party of Sarcees met a few Crees who seeing the Sarcees outnumbered them, fled.
</p>
<p>
  The Sarcees killed nine of them and wounded one.
</p>
<p>
  Bull&rsquo;s Head sprang from his horse and taking a knife from the wounded man stabbed him and took his scalp.
</p>
<p>
  This took place at Long Lake.
</p>

<p>
  In 1866, a party of Sarcee made ready to go to Edmonton to trade. While on the way &ldquo;Bull&rsquo;s Head,&rdquo; &ldquo;Going to the Crees&rdquo; and &ldquo;Little Boy&rdquo; who were following at a distance, hunting for game, thought they saw a wolf on a hill and decided to try and kill it. As they approached near Bull&rsquo;s Head hesitated, telling his companion that he thought the object on the hill was a man and not a wolf, but they would not believe him and finally persuaded him to follow.
</p>
<p>
  When they reached the summit they not only saw one man but a number of Crees who instantly fired upon them.
</p>
<p>
  Bull&rsquo;s Head who was so taken by surprise could not run away. He walked a few steps then the fright seemed to leave him and running he soon joined his companions who had reached the bottom of the hill again. The main party of Sarcees hearing the firing fled also. Little Boy&rsquo;s arrow case was shot off his back, but he was not hurt. &ldquo;Going to the Crees&rdquo; was killed.
</p>
<p>
  After running maybe five or six miles with the enemy following close firing all the time they were met by Bull&rsquo;s Head&rsquo;s wife with two horses.

<h3>
  To Watch: The Art of Making a Tapestry
</h3>



<p>
  Tapestry is one of the oldest forms of woven textile. As a technique, tapestry has been used to create everything from tunics and purses to table covers and chair backs, as well as some of the world's largest and most beautiful pieces of textile art.
</p>
<p>
  In Europe, the great period of tapestry weaving ran from the second half of the 14th century to the end of the 18th century. This period is best known for the production of wall-hangings woven in this technique, which we generally refer to as tapestries. Tapestries were owned by the elite and used to decorate both private and public spaces. Henry VIII is recorded as having 2,000 tapestries hanging in his various palaces.
</p>
<p>
  Large tapestries added vibrant colour to a room. They kept out draughts and provided both entertainment and food for thought through their dramatic depiction of stories from the Bible, mythology and the classics, or their revealing portrayal of fashionable life. They were extremely costly to produce and so served to demonstrate their owner's wealth. Unlike today, tapestries were not simply static objects, but were often rolled up and moved between residences. In the 1540s, King Francis I of France even commissioned a set of tapestries which reproduced the wall decoration of his newly renovated Great Gallery at Fontainebleau Palace in woven form. This set could be rolled up and transported to his other residences.

<p>
  Hannah Ryggen fought against war, abuse of power and social injustice. Textile art was her foremost weapon in this fight. Several of Ryggen's works were direct reactions to political events that occurred in her lifetime, as we will examine later on this page.
</p>
<p>
  Ryggen was born on 21 March 1894 and grew up in a working class community in Malm&ouml;, Sweden, and trained as a teacher. She taught during the day, and took evening classes in drawing and painting with the artist Fredrik Krebs at the technical college in Lund.
</p>
<p>
  On a study trip to Dresden, she met her future husband, the artist Hans Ryggen. The young couple moved to Norway, to &Oslash;rlandet in Tr&oslash;ndelag County.
</p>
<h4>
  Pot Blue
</h4>
<p>
  Ryggen was self-taught in weaving technique and choice of materials. She often took control of the entire artistic process: carding, spinning and dying the yarn herself. With wool coloured with plant dyes, and with current political themes, she helped elevate tapestries from a handicraft to fine art.
</p>
<p>
  Pot blue, also known as "pee blue", became the main colour of her tapestries and stood for the positive aspects of life, longing and dreams. Her love for this colour is reflected in, among other things, the self-portrait <em>Pot Blue</em>.
</p>
<p>
  She used urine to create the beautiful blue colour in the yarn, so the "pee bucket" always stood ready for her guests.
</p>
<h4>
  Activist Works
</h4>
<p>
  The struggle against war, fascism and social injustice characterised Ryggen's works in the 1930s. When the war came to Norway in 1940, Ryggen was personally impacted when her husband was arrested and sent to Grini prison camp. During the war years, Ryggen wove several tapestries in which she protested against the abuse of power by the Germans and honoured Norwegians who died for freedom. Ryggen was a rebel and a peace activist her entire life. Even after her death (2 February 1970 in Trondheim), her works continue to inspire us to stand together and fight injustice, abuse of power and human humiliation.
</p>




<h3>
  To Analyze and Read: <em>Ethiopia</em> (1935)
</h3>

<p>
  Take some time to closely look at and analyze Hannah Ryggen's <em>Ethiopia</em> tapestry. What details do you notice first and why? How did Ryggen use the elements of art and principles of design within the tapestry? After spending some time analyzing <em>Ethiopia</em>, read the following excerpt from Marit Paasche, <a href="https://librarysearch.library.utoronto.ca/permalink/01UTORONTO_INST/14bjeso/alma991106626330006196" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Hannah Ryggen: Threads of Defiance</em></a> (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2019).

<h4>
  Denunciations
</h4>
<p>
  The composition of <em>Ethiopia</em> (<em>Etiopia</em>) (1935) is dominated by two horizontal bands. The lower one is entirely occupied by an abstract pattern, while the upper contains figures, hands, spears and inscriptions. This tapestry is large, and the interplay between vertical and horizontal lines creates a distinctive rhythm. The lower band is made of three pieces sewn together, but apart from subtle differences in the grey-brown background hue, the colour scheme is consistently maintained in all three. As a contrast, Ryggen has woven in geometric forms in untreated dark brown and natural white wool.
</p>
<p>
  The figures in the upper register relate to Italy's invasion of Ethiopia. Here Ryggen has also introduced a red tone: in the African woman on the far-left side, for the bracelets on the wrists of the dark-skinned hands and in the figure of Emperor Haile Selassie.<sup>1</sup> This upper band is in effect a framework for the figures. Ryggen had set up the warp threads originally intending to weave a pillow cover, "but then I saw that it was so beautiful on the surface, and when I subsequently had done the first negro, the rest just fell into place."<sup>2</sup>
</p>
<p>
  The area between the African woman and the white male figure to her right is taken up with an abstract pattern, elements of which resemble spear tips. The white man is wearing a hat, and his sun cross, the symbol of the Nasjonal Samling, the Norwegian far-right party, and also of other Nazi-sympathizing parties is clearly visible.<sup>3</sup> He is probably the French politician Pierre Laval, who was the spokesperson for France in negotiations with Italy. Albert Steen suggests he might also be the Italian ambassador to Ethiopia, who had sworn his allegiance to Selassie just before the Italians began bombing Ethiopian cities.<sup>4</sup>
</p>
<p>
  Below the simple yet intricate ornamentation that contains the words "Haile Selassie" is a row of nine hands&mdash;four black, one white and four yellowish-brown. Ethiopia's emperor is imposing in all his magnificence, and Ryggen's depictions of Selassie bears a certain resemblance to an image of him printed in the weekly <em>Ukebladet Hjemmet</em> in 1935.<sup>5</sup> Further to the right, an African man holds Mussolini's head aloft on a spear, under which is inscribed "hr M": Hannah Ryggen could hardly have made her sentiments regarding the dictator any clearer.<sup>6</sup>
</p>





<h4>
  A protest against the wardaughters
</h4>
<p>
  The Norwegian press devoted many column inches to the conflict between Italy and Ethiopia (then also known as Abyssinia). Both the liberal left newspaper <em>Dagbladet</em> and the Trondheim-based <em>Arbeider-Avisen</em> covered the issue in detail. The latter reported that Italy had mobilized 10 million men and that negotiations in Geneva between Italy and the League of Nations had stalled. Mussolini wanted an empire, but potential targets for conquest were limited. The entire African continent, with the exception of Ethiopia, was already colonized by European countries. Ethiopia's geographical location, between the two existing Italian colonies of Somalia and Eritrea, made the choice an obvious one: with Ethiopia, Mussolini would gain one unified colony with ports and large areas of productive land. Additional motivating factors were a desire for revenge and national pride.
</p>
<p>
  The situation generated significant international attention and demonstrated the impotence of the League of Nations, which could neither protest its own members (Ethiopia was one) nor intervene against militarily aggressive ones. In September 1935 the conflict escalated, and by 3 October, war between Italy and Ethiopia was a fact. The headline on <em>Arbeider-Avisen</em>'s front page ran: "Was has begun. Adua bombed. Fascist troops mobilized yesterday. Mussolini's speech a battle call." ("Krigen er begynt. Adua bombarderes. Enkrigersk tale av Mussolini.")<sup>7</sup> In an attempt to resolve the conflict, the so-called Hoare-Laval Pact was proposed. The Pact, which would essentially allow Italy to partition large areas in Ethiopia, was drafted by the then British Foreign Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare and the French politician Pierre Laval, with the intention of maintaining good relations with Mussolini. It encountered considerable international opposition, however, and led to Hoare's resignation in December 1935. Laval was also forced to resign, but with the Nazi's assistance he later became part of the Vichy regime in France (after the war he was tried and executed).
</p>
<p>
  The Ethiopian army was poorly equipped; most of its soldiers had only hand-weapons with which to defend themselves. Forced to flee, Haile Selassie appealed to the League of Nations, pleading for military support. After delivering his acclaimed speech, he concluded by remarking: "It is us today. It will be you tomorrow."<sup>8</sup> The League's response, however, was evasive, and resulted in no more than an economic and trade boycott of Italy. Such a passive attitude was adopted because Britain and France were then courting Mussolini as an ally against Hitler. Only when Italy officially entered the Second World War on the side of the Germans did the British come to Ethiopia's aid militarily and help secure its independence.<sup>9</sup>
</p>


<p>
  Many on the left saw the League of Nations' weakness in response to Mussolini's invasion of Ethiopia as a stain on its reputation. Hannah Ryggen was no exception. <em>Ethiopia</em> is a castigation against an ineffective and apathetic Europe, woven in outrage over the course of just one month as a protest against the war:
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">An impromptu tapestry<br />woven in haste!<br />black heads&mdash;white diplomats<br />in between clubs and spears,<br />and throughout<br />my determination<br />so nail Mussolini<br />with a black man's spear!<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>
  In contrast to <em>Fishing in the Sea of Debt</em>, <em>Ethiopia</em> is marked by a more modern two-dimensional idiom, with several sections consisting of a monochrome expanse and geometric forms. In a certain way, it references an earlier work, <em>Squall</em> (<em>Verhau</em>) (1928), but in <em>Ethiopia</em> the colours and geometric forms are used to express historical persons and a specific event that occurred during Ryggen's lifetime.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Ethiopia</em> is striking in its combination of refinement and authority. That a woman living in &Oslash;rlandet, a remote region of Norway, in an austere house without running water or electricity, would devote time to denouncing Mussolini and the fascists' actions in Ethiopia in a weaving is a powerful testimony. As Tora Sandal (later Sandal B&oslash;hn), a close friend of Ryggen's and employed at the National Museum of Applied and Decorative Arts in Trondheim, wrote: "With the <em>Ethiopia</em> tapestry, Hannah Ryggen embarked on her impressive series of topical weavings. It was no longer party politics in some narrow sense that interested her, but a greater, universally human sense of what is just and what is reprehensible in international politics."<sup>11</sup>
</p>
<p>
  That <em>Ethiopia</em> functioned as a highly effective denunciation is evident from the fact that it was censored. Out of fear of offending the Italian representatives, the section depicting Mussolini's head on a spear was folded over when the work was exhibited in the Norwegian pavilion at the Paris World's Fair in 1937. Ryggen referred to this in a latter to Andreas Schjoldager: "The <em>Ethiopia</em> tapestry has been accepted by Brukskunst for hte New York exhibition. As long as it isn't hung folded, as it was in Paris, I'll be happy."<sup>12</sup> The Paris World's Fair also included <a href="https://smarthistory.org/picasso-guernica/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Picasso's <em>Guernica</em> (1937)</a> in the Spanish pavilion. This painting, referred to by the Norwegian newspaper <em>Dagbladet</em> as "the civil war picture," would also be shown at the Artists' House (Kunstnernes Hus) in Oslo, thanks to a coordinated effort by gallerist Paul Rosenberg and the Norwegian painter, critic and art dealer Walther Halvorsen.<sup>13</sup> The exhibition, "French Art" ("Fransk kunst"), which opened on 10 January 1938, also displayed works by Georges Braque, Henri Matisse and Henri Laurens.

  To Compare: Documentation vs. Denunciation
</h3>
<p>
  In this week's module, we examined Two Gun's (Sarcee) <em>Painted Buffalo Robe</em> and Ryggen's <em>Ethiopia</em> tapestry while briefly mentioning Picasso's <em>Guernica</em> painting. What are the similarities and differences in how artists used art objects to document and denounce historical and current events? How do different media (robe, tapestry, and painting) affect such objects' function, display, and use? How do different media affect the reading and understanding of historical and current events? How has each artist used formal elements and principles of design to guide viewers through each object's narrative and message?

  To Watch: Surrealism Beyond Borders
</h3>

<h4>
  Art Term: Surrealism
</h4>
<p>
  A twentieth-century literary, philosophical and artistic movement that explored the workings of the mind, championing the irrational, the poetic and the revolutionary. Refer to the <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/s/surrealism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tate's online glossary</a> for more.
</p>




<p>
  Nearly from its inception, Surrealism has had an international scope, but knowledge of the movement has been formed primarily through a Western European focus. Join Stephanie D&rsquo;Alessandro, the Leonard A. Lauder Curator of Modern Art and Senior Research Coordinator in the Department of Modern and Contemporary Art at The Met, and explore this exhibition, which reconsiders the true &ldquo;movement&rdquo; of Surrealism beyond boundaries of geography and chronology&mdash;and within networks that span Eastern Europe to the Caribbean, Asia to North Africa, and Australia to Latin America. Including examples from almost eight decades and produced across at least 45 countries, <em>Surrealism Beyond Borders</em> offers a fresh appraisal of some of the collective concerns and exchanges&mdash;as well as historical, national, and local distinctions&mdash;that will recast appreciation of this most revolutionary and globe-spanning movement.

  Reading: The Life and Art of Dorothea Tanning
</h3>
<h4>
  Reflections on the occasion of her birthday, 25th August
</h4>
<p>
  On the opening page of her first memoir, entitled <em>Birthday</em> (1986), American artist Dorothea Tanning tells us that &ldquo;the beginning is an impossible place.&rdquo; In doing this, she hoped to remind us of the complexity of storytelling, and the impossibility of attempting to distill the richness of lived experience into a single narrative or representation.
</p>
<p>
  Her second memoir is entitled <em>Between Lives</em> (2001). Perhaps both titles allude to a way of understanding her intensely creative life. Her body of work spanned more than seventy years of ceaseless experimentation and included painting, drawing, print and etching, sculptures, fabric installation, etchings, jewellery, costume and set designs, collage, fiction and a considerable body of poetry.
</p>
<p>
  For Tanning, &ldquo;birthdays,&rdquo; as a mark of beginnings, were a metaphor for transformation. Accordingly, her characters are often caught in states of physical, emotional or psychological metamorphosis. Her work demonstrates a preoccupation with thresholds&mdash;liminal and transitional spaces in which fantasy, reality, sensation and imagination converge. From the outset, repeated motifs of doors, wallpaper and cloth are symbols of these thresholds that reveal otherworldly events folded into mundane, everyday spaces.
</p>



<img src="https://artherstory.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-Birthday-by-Dorothea-Tanning-Philadelphia-Art-Museum-1-647x1024.jpg" alt="Dorothea Tanning, Birthday, 1942."/>
<p>
  Image caption: Dorothea Tanning, <em>Birthday</em>, 1942. Oil on canvas, 102.2 x 64.8 cm. Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia.
</p>


<h4>
  Birthday
</h4>
<p>
  Tanning was born in 1910 in Galesburg, Illinois, a town in which she declared &ldquo;nothing ever happened but the wallpaper.&rdquo; Yet she spent a lifetime imagining what might be happening just under the surfaces of those neatly furnished sitting-rooms.
</p>
<p>
  A self-taught creator, she sustained herself as a successful commercial artist while pursuing her own painting. She was in New York as the surrealists began to arrive, exiled or rescued from a ravaged Europe, and she forged deep friendships with the likes of John Cage, Marcel Duchamp, Joseph Cornell and Lee Miller.
</p>
<p>
  While steeped in this artistic milieu and heavily influenced by surrealism, Tanning painted some of her best-known works. In <em>Birthday</em> (1942), the artist depicts herself in the process of metamorphosis, a &ldquo;rebirth&rdquo; from one state to another.
</p>
<p>
  She is strangely composed of hybrid parts, a fusion between reality and fantasy, mundane and magical, urban and rustic. The overall impression of the figure is of a chrysalis emerging from a cocoon. A fusion of both nature and culture, this dazzling young woman stands on the threshold of an unknown, yet exciting, adventure. The technical skill demonstrated in Birthday&mdash;its clarity and precision, typical of the surrealist style&mdash;intensifies the effect of the interwoven strands of fantasy and reality.
</p>
<p>
  In 1999, the Philadelphia Museum of Art acquired Birthday. In the brochure for the survey show, entitled &ldquo;Birthday and Beyond,&rdquo; Tanning noted of the painting:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    It was a modest canvas by present-day standards. But it filled my New York studio, the apartment&rsquo;s back room, as if it had always been there. For one thing, it was the room; I had been struck, one day, by a fascinating array of doors&mdash;hall, kitchen, bathroom, studio&mdash;crowded together, soliciting my attention with their antic planes, light, shadows, imminent openings and shuttings. From there it was an easy leap to a dream of countless doors. Moreover, alone and taking stock of myself, I felt a sort of immanence as if my life was revealing itself at last&mdash;a real birthday.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  The &ldquo;immanence&rdquo; of &ldquo;a real birthday,&rdquo; rather than a calendar one, is a sentiment that captures the multi-layered significance of the &ldquo;rebirth&rdquo; Tanning experienced in 1942. This was also the year Max Ernst came to her apartment on Julien Levy&rsquo;s recommendation to see if she had anything suitable for a show his then wife, Peggy Guggenheim, was planning. Tanning herself has outlined the details of their meeting in both of her memoirs, but Ernst was so impressed by the painting, and presumably by Tanning herself, that he suggested a game of chess after spotting the board and pieces set up in the apartment.
</p>
<p>
  The story which follows is that he never really left. While this may be a slightly poetic gloss over the practicalities of the period, it is also indicative of the intensity between these two artists, and gives us an insight into the type of &ldquo;bohemian&rdquo; lifestyle they would pursue. Near the end of her life, in 1999, Tanning explained that she had never liked celebrating her actual birthday and that she viewed the meeting with Ernst as her symbolic &ldquo;birthday.&rdquo; Accordingly, she had always celebrated it on November 24th (their meeting day) as opposed to the date on her birth register (August 25th).
</p>





<h4>
  Rebirth
</h4>
<p>
  The theme of the transformative potential of the &ldquo;birthday&rdquo; is more violently imagined in the 1943 short story &ldquo;Blind Date,&rdquo; which Tanning published in the short-lived surrealist journal <em>VVV</em>. The piece contains the familiar imagery of doors as indicators of a threshold, as well as the language of physical and psychological excess found in surrealist writing. But, again, Tanning uses the metaphor of rebirth to indicate the pain, delirium and catharsis of a powerful state of creative transformation:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Today you have been born, out of abysmal sorrow and knowledge, out of symbols, destructions, warnings, wounds, pestilence, instruments sacred and obscene, spasms, defilements; out of hates, and holocausts, guts and gothic grandeurs, frenzy, crimes, visions, scorpions, secretions, love and the devil. Today you shall be married to your future.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Tanning relates the physical extremes of birth and conscious awakenings to the larger texture of the violent drama of human history. By doing this she brings together the acts of creation, procreation and destruction, showing us how easily they fold into and around each other in a continuum of life experience. She also describes an intimate account of the creative process in all its explosiveness.
</p>
<p>
  The notion of the &ldquo;birthday&rdquo; resurfaces multiple times in the artist&rsquo;s work. It symbolised an important threshold, a powerful and deeply personal transformative state, rather than the celebration of mere natality. This sentiment is reflected in one of Tanning&rsquo;s poems published in 2002, entitled &ldquo;Secret.&rdquo; The final lines leave us with an image of a world replete with imaginative potential:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    In summer the park, for an hour or so before night,<br />is at its greenest, a whole implicit proposition
  </p>
  <p>
    of green leaves, a triumph of leaves enfolding me<br />that day in a green intimacy so trustworthy I told
  </p>
  <p>
    them my secret. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my birthday,&rdquo; I said out loud<br />before turning away to cross the avenue
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>
  States of flux
</h4>
<p>
  Tanning&rsquo;s work often satellites around the feminine form, its boundaries, movements, abstractions and sensations. She was fascinated with the lived experience of the female body in maternity or when confronted by violence. She depicted childhood and puberty in enigmatic works like <em>The Guest Room</em> (1952) as both desired and dreaded.
</p>
<p>
  Tanning explored relationship dynamics&mdash;in families, among strangers, in the bond between human and animals (particularly dogs)&mdash;through voluptuous surfaces of paint, cloth or tissue paper that convey a sense of perpetual transformation. In works like <em>Family Portrait</em> (1977) she visibly collapses the boundaries between her figures to engage the imagination of any viewer.
</p>
<p>
  One of the key impulses driving her work was to capture the multi-layered nature of lived experience. As she stated:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    I&rsquo;ve been trying for a long time to deal with the figures that emerge on the canvas. Time is needed to know them. In the first years, I was painting our side of the mirror&mdash;the mirror for me is a door&mdash;but I think that I&rsquo;ve gone over, to a place where one no longer faces identities at all. One looks at them somewhat obliquely, slyly. To capture the moment, to accept it with all its complex identities.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Tanning&rsquo;s later works continue to demonstrate this as her characters emerge from and recede into layers of sumptuous paint or as they transform into hybrid states which create expansive, yet enigmatic imagery.
</p>
<h4>
  Always creating
</h4>
<p>
  Having moved to France in the 1950s with Ernst, Tanning returned permanently to New York in 1980 soon after his death in 1976. At 70, she became increasingly interested in writing, becoming an accomplished and well-published poet.
</p>
<p>
  She was still producing extraordinary work when I met her in 2000, having just produced what would be her final body of work, a series of very large flower paintings in 1998.
</p>
<p>
  I would often visit her apartment and we would talk about her work and life and then drink champagne. Our friendship lasted until her death in 2012, at 101. She was mischievous, generous, clever, funny, encouraging, surprising, willful and utterly amazing. By the end of her life she hated the idea of another birthday (unsurprisingly) but she had forged an entirely creative and truly unique life.
</p>
<h4>
  In the spotlight once more
</h4>
<p>
  Her consummate skill as an artist was acknowledged among her peers throughout her life, and her work features in international galleries including Tate, San Francisco and New York Museums of Modern Art, and the Pompidou Centre in Paris.
</p>
<p>
  Tanning&rsquo;s work has recently returned to the spotlight in recognition of its unique contribution to visual art. The first major retrospective of her work in 25 years was held at Museo Nacional Centra de Arte Reina Sof&iacute;a in Spain and London&rsquo;s Tate Modern last year. Her work was also included in the 2013 Venice Biennale.
</p>
<p>
  Scholars have also begun paying more attention to her work. My monograph <a href="https://www.lundhumphries.com/products/dorothea-tanning" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Dorothea Tanning: Transformations</em></a>, published earlier this year, is the first book devoted to exploring every aspect her work, tracing recurrent themes and preoccupations across her career. As an artist interested in exploring the richness of human experience from a distinctly feminine viewpoint, Tanning&rsquo;s work occupies a singular position in the history of modern art.

  Dorothea Tanning was an American surrealist artist whose career spanned over seven decades. Self-taught, her early paintings depict with precision dream-like scenes. Sunflowers, chess pieces, fabric, and doors, always slightly ajar, recur in her work. Dorothea says she "got fed up with the turpentine" and in the 1960s began working with fabric, pioneering the use of soft sculptures. Towards the end of her career, Tanning experimented with colour and a more abstract painting style. These large "prismatic" paintings remain figurative and retain dreamlike and fleshy qualities.

  The first museum exhibition dedicated to the artist in the United States since 2000&mdash;brings together more than 20 paintings Varo created in Mexico from 1955 until her death in 1963. Additional materials from the artist&rsquo;s archive&mdash;large-scale cartoons for paintings, notebooks, sketches, detailed studies, ephemera, and personal possessions&mdash;offer an even deeper understanding of her distinct and diverse practice. The exhibition&rsquo;s subtitle, Science Fictions, alludes to the tensions and possibilities Varo brought together in her work as she searched to visualize hidden orders and unseen truths.

  To Analyze and Read: <em>Creaci&oacute;n de las aves</em> (<em>Creation of the Birds</em>), 1957
</h3>

<p>
  Take some time to closely look at and analyze Remedios Varo's <em>Creaci&oacute;n de las aves</em> (<em>Creation of the Birds</em>) painting. What details do you notice first and why? How did Varo use the elements of art and principles of design within the tapestry? After spending some time analyzing <em>Creaci&oacute;n de las aves</em> (<em>Creation of the Birds</em>), read the following excerpt from Caitlin Haskell and Tere Areq, eds., <em>Remedios Varo: Science Fictions</em> (Chicago: The Art Institute of Chicago, 2023).

</p>




<p>
  Remedios Varo's <em>Creaci&oacute;n de las aves</em> (<em>Creation of the Birds</em>) holds an important place in the artist's body of work. Commissioned in 1957 by Manlio Hern&aacute;ndez for his wife Ana Mar&iacute;a (an admirer of Varo's art), the painting has since enjoyed enthusiastic critical reception, as proven by the number of times it has been exhibited: thirty-four since its first presentation in 1958, including as recently as 2022, when it was featured in <em>The Milk of Dreams</em>, in the 59th Venice Biennale.<sup>1</sup> It is difficult to pin down what has drawn audiences to this work over more than sixty years; perhaps it is the fantastical story or the vivid assemblage of fine details. Or perhaps it is the idea of an alternate world where the rules are different and the potential for the impossible is the norm.
</p>
<p>
  Peering into an intimate room or tower, we witness a hybrid owl-human engaged in a task that at first looks like painting, but is in fact much more. Holding a red -tipped brush strung from an instrument hanging around their neck, the figure applies pigment to a support. This, however, is only half the technique; holding a prism in their other hand, they refract light from a faraway star onto a newly painted bird. Somehow, this combination breathes life into the image, which, now animated, lifts off the page and spreads its wings to join its avian companions rushing toward the window. The details&mdash;a painter's palette, a prism, a complex system of beakers and pipe stills, and a coffee roaster&mdash;evoke both a laboratory and a studio, yet the act of creation Varo depicted operates well beyond the laws of science or the rules of artful mimesis.<sup>2</sup>
</p>
<p>
  Many scholars, including Tere Arcq, Georgiana M. M. Colvile, Janet A. Kaplan, and Magnolia Rivera, have written about the symbolic elements and Varo's references in this painting.<sup>3</sup> It is considered one of her most representative works and the one that best expresses her ideal union of art, nature, and science. Indeed, Varo depicted the moment of creation as a balancing act of forces: in nature (external material substance, starlight, primordial elements), art (executing hand, brush, pigments, subject matter), and science broadly defined (alchemy, instruments, vessels and pipe stills, the processes of change and decomposition). One concept in particular bridges the various currents of thought from which the artist drew and, at the same time, allows these mutually exclusive dimensions to coexist: transmutation.
</p>
<p>
  A process that changes the essence of a material, transmutation is central to notions of alchemy, which involves separating the material and spiritual properties of elements to isolate the inherent physical properties capable of mutability.<sup>4</sup> Unlike transformation, which implies the modification of an external form, transmutation describes a change to the internal structure. This theme also related to evolutionary biology, chemistry, and taxonomy appears again and again in Varo's works. Varo identified art&mdash;something capable of modifying the order of everyday life and introducing other systems of knowledge and perception&mdash;as a productive point of departure for engaging these scientific ideas.
</p>
<p>
  Varo's choice of protagonist alludes to birds' symbolism of knowledge in various cultures and disciplines. The ancient Greeks, for example, practiced ornithomancy (called augury by the ancient Romans), interpreting the flight of birds as omens; Germanic tradition assigns these animals the role of messengers between the worlds of life and death; and alchemists developed a complex nomenclature in which each of the four stages of the quest for essential materials is represented by a type of bird: raven, peacock, swan, and phoenix. The owl has long been considered wise: the Greeks represented Athena, the goddess of wisdom, with one of these birds on her shoulder, and the white owl became the symbol of alchemists and, by extension, of chemists during the transition to the so-called modern era.<sup>5</sup>
</p>
<p>
  In these contexts, however, wisdom does not mean the accumulation of knowledge but rather the ability to see beyond the limits of what is evident&mdash;another point of connection with Varo's understanding of art. In <em>Creaci&oacute;n de las aves</em>, Varo introduced play between the image and the object, appearances and the real. She perceived and created&mdash;that is, revealed&mdash;what is not there; she did not represent but rather transformed with her gaze and hand. The figure creating the birds oscillates among human being, alchemist, scientist, and demiurge; the creator uses vessels, pipe stills, and prisms to distill the elements around them into a source of primary colors, which form the base of every possible combination of color and imbue life with a spiritual force.
</p>
<p>
  The illusory potential of painting has been celebrated since ancient times, reflected acutely in the legendary challenge between the painters Zeuxis and Parrhasius, narrated in Pliny the Elder's first-century CE <em>Natural History</em>. According to this story, both artists agreed to a competition to settle who was the best&mdash;meaning most realistic&mdash;painter of their time. Zeuxis presented first; his painting of grapes in a bowl exhibited such realism that birds attempted to eat them. Filled with pride at his achievement, Zeuxis requested that Parrhasius lift the veil covering his work&mdash;only to find that the veil did not actually exist, but was painted by Parrhasius. Having been deceived by the work himself, Zeuxis conceded victory.
</p>
<p>
  Pliny the Elder's tale has captured the imaginations of countless artists, historians, and thinkers, including French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, who further explored the nature of appearance, its character of double deception, and the possibilities of the visible.<sup>6</sup> Varo herself depicted curtains, as we see in one of her sketchbooks. Her interest, however, was always in how she could show more than the visible; even the simplest veil is charged with a supernatural presence.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Creaci&oacute;n de las aves</em> is more than just an allegory of the creative act; Varo reexamined, criticized, and redefined the hierarchy that had long privileged the attainment of visual similitude. There is no game of mimesis but rather an unveiling to realms beyond sight. The birds cease to simply represent elements of the world and instead reveal the transmutative nature of art&mdash;or the creative act&mdash;enacted through the gazes of the artist and viewers of the work. For Varo, verisimilitude&mdash;an artistic achievement that preoccupied artists throughout much Western history&mdash;was only a means to an end; art is a revelation, as are nature and science.
</p>
<p>
  To facilitate the act of painting, Varo's bird-creator wears a three-stringed instrument around their neck from which the paintbrush extends. This representation of the artist recalls Russian Armenian philosopher and mystic George I. Gurdjieff's ideas about art, specifically his distinction between objective and subjective art.<sup>7</sup> For him, objective art is the product of a fully conscious effort, and it is capable of making a precise impression to reveal profound knowledge. He focused mainly on his view that the universe is composed of vibrations in continuous movement; the cosmos is a scale of seven notes, each of which can be subdivided. In the method he developed at the Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man, music and dance occupied a central place in the quest to reach the higher state of consciousness, to reach the "cosmic octave."<sup>8</sup> Varo's reference is explicit in the bird-creator: the act of creation must be a conscious and spiritual act&mdash;only then is transmutation possible.
</p>
<p>
  Curiously, in the preparatory drawing for the work, the coffee mill that we see in the background of the final painting is not present. Why did the artist include it in the final composition? This domestic element alludes to a process of transformation of material, converting the beans into granules, but it also suggests that the domestic sphere is a kind of laboratory for everyday life. As author Janet A. Kaplan has pointed out, Varo "concocted pseudo-scientific research in the form of recipes."<sup>9</sup> In this light, the kitchen is the place of the alchemist and the scientist.
</p>
<p>
  This conceptualization requires rereading the figure in <em>Creaci&oacute;n de las aves,</em> whose form oscillates between two animal beings and whose gender is indeterminate. This ambiguity upends patriarchal understandings of what constitutes a creator, making space for an androgynous and animal creator who reflects the artist's broad ecofeminist view.<sup>10</sup> It also allowed Varo to correlate and blend the wide-ranging sources that supported her aesthetic-scientific-natural ideal&mdash;especially alchemy, the development of the universe as theorized by English scientist Sir Fred Hoyle, and the debates that she followed in scientific magazines of the time.<sup>11</sup> Varo's ideal is that of generous collaboration and interdisciplinary cross-mingling, not the compartmentalization, restriction, and exclusion typical of Western approaches to disciplines of knowledge (and art). If there is any hope, Varo situates it here, in the place where birds fly free&mdash;not as outwitted grape eaters but possibly as seers or, simply, as birds.

  Enghelab Shod [Farsi for &ldquo;The Revolution Happened&rdquo;] is an oral history project on memories of the 1979 Iranian revolution. Our goal is to understand this grand historical event from the perspective of everyday folks who lived through it. We explore how people remember &ldquo;the revolution&rdquo; and with which places, dates, objects and emotions they associate these memories. Our project prioritizes documenting embodied and affective experiences as narrated through the lens of memory. This approach extends beyond common historiographies&rsquo; penchant for meta-narratives of political chronologies, and instead emphasizes the revolution as a complex lived experience that is diversely memorialized by people who live through it.
</p>
<p>
  This project is based on professionally recorded oral history interviews with diasporic Iranians in Canada. In these interviews, we ask participants to describe how they learnt that &ldquo;the revolution happened&rdquo;: when, where, and how they began to name and recognize the ongoing political unrest as the culmination of a revolution. We also ask participants to share specific artifacts that are associated with these memories. The diverse age range of our participants provides rich insight in the experience of the revolution at various life stages, including in late childhood and adolescence.
</p>
<p>
  The aim of this project is to create opportunities for intergenerational (and intercultural) communication about life amidst historical change, particularly for younger generations of Iranians for whom the &ldquo;revolution&rdquo; has been an abstract background to their lives. To do so, we are creating a publicly accessible online archive to showcase the recorded interviews and collected artifacts in English and Farsi. This project is informed by our own personal interest in understanding the revolution, and what it meant to live through it.

</p>
<h3>
  Reading: Shirin Neshat, <em>Rebellious Silence</em>, <em>Women of Allah</em> Series
</h3>



<p>
  In <em>Rebellious Silence</em>, the central figure&rsquo;s portrait is bisected along a vertical seam created by the long barrel of a rifle. Presumably the rifle is clasped in her hands near her lap, but the image is cropped so that the gun rises perpendicular to the lower edge of the photo and grazes her face at the lips, nose, and forehead. The woman&rsquo;s eyes stare intensely towards the viewer from both sides of this divide.
</p>
<p>
  Shirin Neshat&rsquo;s photographic series <em>Women of Allah</em> examines the complexities of women&rsquo;s identities in the midst of a changing cultural landscape in the Middle East&mdash;both through the lens of Western representations of Muslim women, and through the more intimate subject of personal and religious conviction.
</p>
<p>
  While the composition&mdash;defined by the hard edge of her black chador against the bright white background&mdash;appears sparse, measured and symmetrical, the split created by the weapon implies a more violent rupture or psychic fragmentation. A single subject, it suggests, might be host to internal contradictions alongside binaries such as tradition and modernity, East and West, beauty and violence. In the artist&rsquo;s own words, &ldquo;every image, every woman&rsquo;s submissive gaze, suggests a far more complex and paradoxical reality behind the surface.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup>
</p>
<p>
  The <em>Women of Allah</em> series confronts this &ldquo;paradoxical reality&rdquo; through a haunting suite of black-and-white images. Each contains a set of four symbols that are associated with Western representations of the Muslim world: the veil, the gun, the text and the gaze. While these symbols have taken on a particular charge since 9/11, the series was created earlier and reflects changes that have taken place in the region since 1979, the year of the Islamic Revolution in Iran.
</p>
<h4>
  Islamic Revolution
</h4>
<p>
  Iran had been ruled by the Shah (Mohammad Reza Pahlavi), who took power in 1941 during the Second World War and reigned as King until 1979, when the Persian monarchy was overthrown by revolutionaries. His dictatorship was known for the violent repression of political and religious freedom, but also for its modernization of the country along Western cultural models. Post-war Iran was an ally of Britain and the United States, and was markedly progressive with regards to women&rsquo;s rights. The Shah&rsquo;s regime, however, steadily grew more restrictive, and revolutionaries eventually rose to abolish the monarchy in favor of a conservative religious government headed by Ayatollah Khomeini.
</p>
<p>
  Shirin Neshat was born in 1957 in the town of Qazvin. In line with the Shah&rsquo;s expansion of women&rsquo;s rights, her father prioritized his daughters&rsquo; access to education, and the young artist attended a Catholic school where she learned about both Western and Iranian intellectual and cultural history. She left, however, in the mid-1970s, pursuing her studies in California as the environment in Iran grew increasingly hostile. It would be seventeen years before she returned to her homeland. When she did, she confronted a society that was completely opposed to the one that she had grown up in.
</p>
<h4>
  Looking Back
</h4>
<p>
  One of the most visible signs of cultural change in Iran has been the requirement for all women to wear the veil in public. While many Muslim women find this practice empowering and affirmative of their religious identities, the veil has been coded in Western eyes as a sign of Islam&rsquo;s oppression of women. This opposition is made more clear, perhaps, when one considers the simultaneity of the Islamic Revolution with women&rsquo;s liberation movements in the U.S. and Europe, both developing throughout the 1970s. Neshat decided to explore this fraught symbol in her art as a way to reconcile her own conflicting feelings. In Women of Allah, initiated shortly after her return to Iran in 1991, the veil functions as both a symbol of freedom and of repression.
</p>
<h4>
  The Veil and the Gaze
</h4>
<p>
  The veil is intended to protect women&rsquo;s bodies from becoming the sexualized object of the male gaze, but it also protects women from being seen at all. The &ldquo;gaze&rdquo; in this context becomes a charged signifier of sexuality, sin, shame, and power. Neshat is cognizant of feminist theories that explain how the &ldquo;male gaze&rdquo; is normalized in visual and popular culture: Women&rsquo;s bodies are commonly paraded as objects of desire in advertising and film, available to be looked at without consequence. Many feminist artists have used the action of &ldquo;gazing back&rdquo; as a means to free the female body from this objectification. The gaze, here, might also reflect exotic fantasies of the East. In Orientalist painting of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, for instance, Eastern women are often depicted nude, surrounded by richly colored and patterned textiles and decorations; women are envisaged amongst other beautiful objects that can be possessed. In Neshat&rsquo;s images, women return the gaze, breaking free from centuries of subservience to male or European desire.
</p>
<p>
  Most of the subjects in the series are photographed holding a gun, sometimes passively, as in Rebellious Silence, and sometimes threateningly, with the muzzle pointed directly towards the camera lens. With the complex ideas of the &ldquo;gaze&rdquo; in mind, we might reflect on the double meaning of the word &ldquo;shoot,&rdquo; and consider that the camera&mdash;especially during the colonial era&mdash;was used to violate women&rsquo;s bodies. The gun, aside from its obvious references to control, also represents religious martyrdom, a subject about which the artist feels ambivalently, as an outsider to Iranian revolutionary culture.
</p>
<h4>
  Poetry
</h4>
<p>
  The contradictions between piety and violence, empowerment and suppression, are most prevalent in the use of calligraphic text that is applied to each photograph. Western viewers who do not read Farsi may understand the calligraphy as an aesthetic signifier, a reference to the importance of text in the long history of Islamic art. Yet, most of the texts are transcriptions of poetry and other writings by women, which express multiple viewpoints and date both before and after the Revolution. Some of the texts that Neshat has chosen are feminist in nature. However, in Rebellious Silence, the script that runs across the artist&rsquo;s face is from Tahereh Saffarzadeh&rsquo;s poem &ldquo;Allegiance with Wakefulness&rdquo; which honors the conviction and bravery of martyrdom. Reflecting the paradoxical nature of each of these themes, histories and discourses, the photograph is both melancholic and powerful&mdash;invoking the quiet and intense beauty for which Neshat&rsquo;s work has become known.
</p>
<p>
  As an outspoken, feminist and progressive artist, Neshat is aware that it would be dangerous to show her work in conservative modern-day Iran, and she has been living in exile in the United States since the 1990s. For audiences in the West, the &ldquo;Women of Allah&rdquo; series has allowed a more nuanced contemplation of common stereotypes and assumptions about Muslim women, and serves to challenge the suppression of female voices in any community.

  Reading: Beyond Gender: Indigenous Perspectives, Fa&rsquo;afafine and Fa&rsquo;afatama
</h3>





</h3>
<p>
  In fact, numerous Indigenous communities around the world do not conflate gender and sex; rather, they recognize a third or more genders within their societies. Individuals that identify as a third gender many times have visible and socially recognizable positions within their societies and sometimes are thought to have unique or supernatural power that they can access because of their gender identity. However, as European influence and westernized ideologies began to spread and were, in many cases, forced upon Indigenous societies, third genders diminished, along with so many other Indigenous cultural traditions. Nevertheless, the cultural belief and acceptance of genders beyond a binary system still exist in traditional societies around the world. In many cases, these third gender individuals represent continuing cultural traditions and maintain aspects of cultural identity within their communities.
</p>
<p>
  Within a Western and Christian ideological framework, individuals who identify as a third gender are often thought of as part of the LGBTQ community. This classification actually distorts the concept of a third gender and reflects a culture that historically recognizes only two genders based on sex assigned at birth&mdash;male or female&mdash;and anyone acting outside of the cultural norms for their sex may be classified as homosexual, gender queer, or transgender, among other classifications. In societies that recognize a third gender, the gender classification is not based on sexual identity, but rather on gender identity and spirituality. Individuals who identify with a cultural third gender are, in fact, acting within their gender/sex norm.
</p>
<h4>
  Fa&rsquo;afafine and Fa&rsquo;afatama, Samoa 
</h4>
<p>
  Many third gender individuals hold integral roles within societies and are well respected for their strength, hard work, and ability to discuss taboo topics. On the island of Samoa, there are four recognized cultural genders: female, male, fa&rsquo;afafine, and fa&rsquo;afatama. Fa&rsquo;afafine and fa&rsquo;afatama are fluid gender roles that move between male and female worlds. These third and fourth gender groups tend to care for elders in the community and educate others about sex, a topic considered taboo in public conversations for male and female genders.
</p>



<img role="presentation" src="https://nhm.org/sites/default/files/styles/wysiwyg_side/public/2020-09/taupou.png" alt=""/>
<p>
  Image caption: Image of a Taupou Fa'afafine Artist by Milena Acosta
</p>


<p>
  One of the lasting cultural performances both preserved and revamped by fa'afafine and fa'afatama is the dance of the taupou. The taupou, or ceremonial hostess typically selected by the high chief in the village, is charged with representing and entertaining visitors. Traditionally, the taupou's dignity and grace expressed the ideals of appropriate female behavior. These displays were particularly favored by Christian missionaries that idealized the taupou's "virginal" and virtuous qualities. Today, when fa'afafine and fa'afatama participate in pageants, they will sometimes take on the role of the taupou, displaying grace and femininity while also making a caricature of the Christian-colonial ideal through sexual humor and body language. This take on the taupou's performance demonstrates the unique ability for fa'fafine and fa'afatama to transcend gender roles and leverage their skills to open the door for discussion on taboo subject through humor.
</p>


<p>
  As ceremonial hosts, taupou wear traditional Samoan dress, such as the ʻie tōga which is a finely woven mat worn tightly wrapped around the body. These mats traditionally have unwoven fringe at the edge and a strip of red feathers.
</p>
<p>
  Crucial to the outfit is the ula nifo, a whale tooth necklace, a status symbol usually restricted to chiefs and their offspring, and likely an element held over from the days when the taupou was only performed by the virgin daughter of a chief. This necklace is made of sliced sperm whale teeth, and it was collected in Fiji in the 1890s. At that time the collector noted, &ldquo;this ornament has the same relative value as a diamond necklace&hellip;&rdquo; indicating that this type necklace was highly prized by many Polynesian cultures.

<h4>
  Fa&rsquo;afafine and Fa&rsquo;afatama still thrive today. 
</h4>
<p>
  In today&rsquo;s dances, the taupou will carry a lightweight replica of a nifo&lsquo;oti, a large club modeled after cane knives of early nineteenth-century English and American whalers. Carrying these during the dance is reminiscent of pre-battle performances where heirloom clubs were artfully twirled and thrown to demonstrate the warrior&rsquo;s prowess. This club was collected in Samoa between 1908&ndash;1910.
</p>
<p>
  Today, one of the ways fa&rsquo;afafine and fa&rsquo;afatama contribute to the care of elders is by participating in the popular beauty pageants whose proceeds go to charities like Mapuifagalele, Western Samoa&rsquo;s home for the aged. In these pageants, fa&rsquo;afafine and fa&rsquo;afatama often perform the dance of the taupou. The portrayal by fa&rsquo;afafine and fa&rsquo;afatama of taupou in these beauty pageants carries a different kind of message than when it was traditionally performed by the virgin daughter of a chief; however, the grace, beauty, and poise of the taupou continues to be the core message of the dance.

<h3>
  To Watch: Yuki Kihara: <em>Paradise Camp</em> at the Venice Biennale 2022
</h3>
<p>
  Starting this week (Week 10), we can engage with videos of the artists who created the monuments being examined. On the previous page, we heard from Shirin Neshat about her reflections as an artist and an Iranian woman. To wrap up our exploration of identities this week, we will listen to Yuki Kihara, who is of mixed Japanese and Samoan heritage, <a href="https://youtu.be/w3BTJ9SPPHU?si=SJiLIHGNiZsM5ECJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talk about showcasing queer rights and revealing the toxic influence of colonialism in her works (12:42, video)</a>. Select "CC" in the video for closed captioning.
</p>
<p>
  The artist Yuki Kihara (b. 1975), who is of Japanese and Samoan descent, brought some tropical sunshine and more than a flash of gender political heat into the gloomy depths of Venice&rsquo;s Arsenale, with a presentation that foregrounds queer rights, small island ecologies and decolonization, among other hot topics.
</p>
<p>
  As the first artist to represent New Zealand in Venice who identifies as Pasifika, Asian and fa&rsquo;afafine (Samoan for someone who is born male but presents &ldquo;in the manner of a woman&rdquo;), Kihara is pulling no punches. Her installation, <em>Paradise Camp</em>, was inspired by an essay by Ngahuia Te Awekotuku that was presented at a Paul Gauguin Symposium in 1992, at the Auckland Art Gallery, drawing attention to the sexual ambiguity of some of the characters so vividly evoked by Gauguin. Kihara has repaid the compliment by staging photos inspired by Gauguin&rsquo;s Tahiti paintings, using sites and people of Samoan origin, to reflect those similarities and celebrate Gauguin&rsquo;s recognition of non-western and non-binary beauty. These are on show in Venice, as is a new film, also called Paradise Camp. Shot on location in Upolu Island, Samoa, it features a local cast and crew, mostly drawn from the the fa&rsquo;afafine community, and its various chapters include one segment that playfully interrogates indigenous vs. colonial attitudes to art and culture, featuring a group of &ldquo;ordinary Samoans&rdquo; who end up mocking and deconstructing the kind of white cultural tropes that are taken for granted in Europe, but are unfamiliar in Samoan art education.
</p>
<p>
  Kihara, who works across photography, film, performance, curation and installations, studied fashion design at Wellington Polytechnic (now Massey University). While she was still a student, the National Museum of New Zealand, Te Papa Tongarewa, purchased a work of hers, a rare accolade. The work was <a href="https://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/object/216354" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Graffiti Dress &mdash; Bombacific</em></a>, which blended 26 T-shirts featuring corporate logos into one fabulous creation. In 2008, she had a solo show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Entitled <em>Living Photographs</em>, it explored the exotic poses and tableaus captured by 19th-century colonial and non-indigenous photographers, such as Thomas Andrew and Alfred John Tattersall, which had helped to spread inaccurate stereotypes about Pacific islanders and their culture, many of which still prevail. [Recall our study of Gottfried Lindauer's portraits of the Māori from Week 7. What overlapping themes and issues are present in Yuki Kihara's works?]
</p>
<p>
  Kihara&rsquo;s work is now in the MoMA collection, the Te Papa Tongarewa Museum, Queensland Art Gallery &amp; Gallery of Modern Art, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the British Museum and Kaohsiung Museum of Fine Arts, Taiwan.

<h3>
  A Brief History of Theory in Art History
</h3>
<p>
  After ten weeks of FAH101H1F, I know you are all enthralled with the prospect of studying more art history! As noted in Week 1, art historians ask a lot of questions to gain an understanding of the artists, patrons, function, audience, reception, style, and iconography of each work. To support this work, art historians engage with theories to inform our work.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Watch</strong> <a href="https://youtu.be/Wn2Azw47bW0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">James Elkins' "A Brief History of Theory in Art History" video (22:29)</a> for a talk about the ways people have thought about theories (semiotics, feminism, iconography, deconstruction, psychoanalysis, style analysis, connoisseurship, etc.) and theorists (Panofsky, W&ouml;lfflin, Ranci&egrave;re, Laruelle, Malabou, Foucault, Deleuze, etc.) in the discipline of art history. Select "CC" in the video for closed captioning.
</p>
<p>
  There was a period before art history called its interpretive methods "theories," and then a period in which art historians identified what they did, and implicitly distinguished it from what neighbouring disciplines did, by enumerating their theories. In the 21st century theories have proliferated, but so has the idea that art historians don't need or use theories and that inquiry can be guided by the objects themselves or by any number of individual texts. Through all these changes there's been the question of what art history does differently from other fields.
</p>
<p>
  James Elkins is E.C. Chadbourne Professor in the Department of Art History, Theory, and Criticism, School of the Art Institute of Chicago. His most recent book is <em>What Photography Is</em>. He writes on art and non-art images; recent books include <em>Chinese Landscape Painting as Western Art History</em> (Hong Kong University Press) and <em>Art Critiques: A Guide</em> (New Academia).

<h3>
  Two Brief Readings

<p>
  As we consider the skills we need for further art historical analyses and discussions, it is helpful to explore the methodological debates that have shaped and continue to shape the discipline. Let's start by reading two brief sections&mdash;Introduction and A Variety of Interpretations: A Preview from Michael Hatt and Charlotte Klonk's <em>Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods</em> (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2006).

  Reading: Remapping the World

<h4>
  Amiable Protest and Africouture
</h4>
<p>
  "In a way, when people see an artist of African origin, they think: oh, he is here to protest. Yes, okay. I am here to protest, but I am going to do it like a gentleman. It is going to look very nice. You are not even going to realize that I am protesting, you are going to invite me to your museum because the work is nice, and then when I am inside, it is too late. But I have to do it nicely&mdash;because if I am already coming to you with a knife, you're going to send me away."
</p>
<p>
  Yinka Shonibare CBE was born in London and raised in Nigeria. He studied art at Goldsmiths College in London and today is one of the most widely known and successful Afro-British artists. In 2019, he was given the title Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire and has since added the acronym CBE to his official name. Well-versed in postcolonial cultural theory, Shonibare sees himself as a "postcolonial hybrid" who practices the genteel restraint of a British gentleman and has gained access to the most prestigious museums of the Western world with his exquisitely tailored parodies of the lifestyle of the British upper classes. Shonibare's amiable and stylistically consummate subversion consists in his signature use of double-sided, colourfully printed cotton fabrics to invade the art and museum worlds. Seen as typically African, the fabrics are a telling example of global colonial entanglements; known as Dutch wax, the fabrics were originally created in an attempt to imitate the patterns of the elaborately handcrafted Indonesian batik fabrics and produce them on an industrial scale in a textile printing process.
</p>

<h4>
  Art Term: Postcolonial Art
</h4>
<p>
  Postcolonial art refers to art produced in response to the aftermath of colonial rule, frequently addressing issues of national and cultural identity, race and ethnicity. Refer to the <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/p/postcolonial-art" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tate's online glossary</a> for more.
</p>

<p>
  However, the new mass product failed to be successful in the Dutch colony and, in the nineteenth century, found its way to West Africa, where a market for the printed cotton fabrics developed. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the fabrics came to be designed and produced mainly in the Netherlands and England, while Africa became the largest market for them. Today, much of the production takes place in Africa and China; only the most expensive fabrics are made in Holland. The Dutch town of Helmond near Eindhoven is where Vlisco's exquisite patterns are created, which are then used to tailor "Africouture" clothing in West Africa. And this is also where Shonibare obtains the fabrics for his postcolonial role plays and ironic deconstructions of Victorian traditions and customs.
</p>
<p>
  The hybrid history of the wax prints and their multifarious symbolic appropriation as an expression of supposed authenticity, fashionable individuality and cultural belonging reveal the ambivalent and asymmetric relationship between colonial power and colonized, which persists to the present day. Shonibare's subversive strategy, meanwhile, consists in harnessing the colonial past and postcolonial present of his industrially manufactured material to create works which visually seduce the viewer, while at the same time revealing themselves as self-reflective constructs. His work relies on theatricality and employs visual alienating effects which comment on and, in doing so, subvert the beautiful or historical illusion. Similar to the concept of metafiction used in postmodern literary theory, he seeks to critically examine the relationship of art and life by means of parody? When dressing headless figures in Victorian fashion, bedecking interiors with pseudo-African fabrics or staging himself in a period series as an admired black dandy of the Victorian Empire, he always occupies a dual position which, incapable of being assimilated or exoticized, instead explores the third space where cultures meet and mix. The objective of Shonibare's playful visual grammar is to show hybridity, while at the same time consistently frustrating any desire for authenticity in the sense of a longing for immediacy, originality, genuineness and purity.

</p>


<p>
  England's rise to colonial world power from the eighteenth century on serves as the preferred historical backdrop for his installations. For his early work <em>The Victorian Philanthropist's Parlour</em> (1996&ndash;1997) Shonibare already recreated a Victorian drawing room with chair, chaise longue, tables, carpets, fireplace and mirror. The persuasive power of a Victorian period room in this conceptual work is already countered by its set-like appearance, but even more effective are the wax prints with which the artist upholstered the walls and all the furniture and which are printed with colourful floral patterns and images of African footballers. This anachronism serves both to blur the boundary between fiction and historiography and to visualize British colonial rule and its consequences. In this ostensible stage set of British domestic life and culture, Shonibare enacts the drama of postcolonialism.
</p>
<p>
  The by now iconic photo series <em>Diary of a Victorian Dandy</em>, which in 1998 was placarded in numerous stations of the London Underground, featured Shonibare himself in the Victorian interior, appearing as a Victorian-African dandy whose daily routine is depicted in five tableaux vivants. Each time, the Black artist is the centre of attention and the composition; all admiring eyes of his white servants, friends and guests are on him when he is awakened in the morning, discusses business matters in the library and subsequently plays billiards. The evening is spent in the company of beautiful women and with the accompaniment of chamber music, with the final picture showing late-night debauchery involving both sexes. Shonibare presents impossible situations by drawing on the conversation pieces of William Hogarth and inverting the hierarchy of skin colour, so that the racist regime of the gaze underlying this type of genre painting is made obvious. Not interested in Hogarth's moralism, he instead presents and celebrates sexual excess, lavish luxury and the wilful and anti-bourgeois decadence of the dandy. Shonibare's relationship to the Victorian era is ambivalent; on the one hand, he is personally fascinated with Victorian style, refined luxury and the exquisite taste of the British aristocracy, but on the other, he emphasizes the inhuman flipside of the Victorian era: "Of course I realized, as an African, that Victorian values for me, were very draconian&hellip; The Victorians colonized Afrika. Basically, the Victorians made Africans work to produce a great empire. So Victorian values, to me, were values of repression, values of making me feel inferior."
</p>
<p>
  With <em>Scramble for Africa</em> (2003), Shonibare created a particularly impressive tableau illustrating the colonization of the African continent and the imperial cupidity of the European powers. This expansive installation references the Congo Conference which took place in Berlin in 1884&ndash;85 and served as the basis for the colonial partitioning of Africa. A contemporary map of Africa showing the then current state of European occupation is embedded in the middle of the oblong conference table. Seated at it are fourteen headless figures clad in Dutch wax who represent the states participating in the conference and whose "scramble" augurs the so-called race for Africa. By the turn of the century, the participating colonial powers had already divided ninety percent of the territory of Africa among themselves.

  Ever since the late 1990s, Shonibare had been employing exceptionally well-dressed, but headless mannequins to both celebrate and satirise the gallantries, excesses, duels and bucolic leisure activities, in short, the decadent and sumptuous lifestyle of polite society or, alternatively, the quest for knowledge of Europe's educated classes. As guillotined or headless bodies, the figures are robbed of their individuality, more illusion than reality, their skin colour ambiguous&mdash;they are bearers of cultural patterns, instruments of deception, objects of desire and reflect historical experiences and power relations.
</p>
<p>
  More recently, a keen interest in cartography and globes has been evident in Shonibare's work. In his reconfigurations of classical sculptures, again featuring the typical Dutch wax batik design, the heads have been replaced with hand-coloured globes. Through this critical gesture in the beautiful guise of classical aesthetics, Shonibare calls for historical multi-perspectivity and a rethinking of space, mobility and cultural identity. The binary division of the world into "we" and "the others", East and West, First and Third World is, after all, based on strict rules of inclusion and exclusion. Moreover, the current geopolitical order is dynamic, and the present-day phrase "the Global South", as an orienting term for the non-hegemonic regions of this world, already represents a reordering of geography, at least in terms of societal and economic dynamics.
</p>
<p>
  <em>The World at the Time of the Surrealists</em>, a surrealist world map published in the Belgian magazine <em>Vari&eacute;t&eacute;s</em> in 1929, already depicted a world whose familiar contours have gone out of whack. In it certain countries and world regions gain significantly in size, while others have become infinitesimally small. The Soviet Union and China are among the winners, some regions, however, have increased tremendously in size, including the island world of the South Pacific which dominates the centre of the new world map. Alaska and Greenland as well as Mexico and Peru also appear significantly larger, whereas the British Isles have moved to the far western edge of the surreal world image and, shrunk to miniature size, appear smaller than the Hawaiian island chain in the Pacific. The USA have completely disappeared and all that is left of France is Paris, the capital of Surrealism. The playfully curving equatorial line may imply that the map not only counters European reason by offering a different topography, but also that a world of the unconscious, fantasy and imagination is entered. Of central importance, however, is the discrediting of the colonial powers expressed in this subversive map picture.

<p>
  World images may be understood as a way of giving form to beliefs through which humans reassure themselves of their place in the world and the world as such. They are based on time- and culture-bound assumptions about the world and manifest themselves in world maps which, while indispensable as tools to visually communicate knowledge, invariably offer mere model-like representations of the earth and as planar projections visualize very different viewpoints and culturally determined perceptual conventions. Shonibare has applied his aesthetic concept of playful hybridity and sly, ironic reframing of cultural and visual stereotypes also to Christian imaginings of the world in the Latin Middle Ages. Commissioned to create work for Hereford Cathedral in West England, he engaged in an in-depth study of the medieval world map located there. The largest and most important surviving universal map of the Middle Ages, it was created for the cathedral around 1300 by Richard de Haldingham. The map is drawn on a single sheet of vellum using black, red, blue or green and gold ink and mounted on an oak panel. The monumental panel shows the earth as a flat, almost circular land mass traversed by rivers and mountain ranges, interspersed with seas and lakes and encircled by a narrow strip of ocean. The map relies on a basic model of representation going back to antiquity: it is a so-called "T-O map," meaning a circular, O-shaped image of the world divided into three parts by bodies of water arranged in the shape of a T. Depicting the ecumenical community as <em>orbis tripartitus</em> with the three continents known at the time, the east-oriented map shows Asia taking up the entire upper semicircle and Europe and Africa the left and right half of the lower semicircle. The Mediterranean, the Don and the Nile are located in the midst of the three continents. Not a travel map, the Hereford map is to be understood as a universal <em>imago mundi</em>, an image of the world. In the centre of the map, and thus of the world, appears Jerusalem, the city from which the history of salvation started out. Strikingly, Europe includes considerably more topographical details, rivers and cities than Asia or Africa. The farther you move away from city-rich Europe and from Asia Minor and North Africa towards the edges, the wilder and more inhospitable the areas and the stronger the animals and human beings you encounter on your graphic hike. You meet legendary peoples, hybrid creatures and curious animals scattered across the entire earth backdrop. India and Ethiopia have the largest share of them: India is home to the sciapods, the pygmies and the giants, the mouthless people, the manticore and the unicorn. North of lndia, in Scythia and neighbouring countries and islands, we encounter humans with horse's hooves, long-eared people and man-eaters. Ethiopia is home to satyrs and fauns, to long-lipped people and ones with faces between the shoulders and on the chest. Some of the wondrous beings must, in fact, have left their ancestral homelands following the discovery of America, for the European conquerors spotted dog-headed creatures (cynocephali) and headless Blemmyes in Latin America as well.
</p>
<p>
  The dwellers at the earth's edge shown in the Hereford map refer to numerous fantastic mythical creatures which already preoccupied the ancient authors. Pliny's <em>Natural History</em> and <em>De mirabilibus mundi</em>, a "collection of curiosities" compiled by the late antique polyhistor Solinus who is repeatedly mentioned in the mop, passed down those mythological narrative which forced the church fathers to somehow explain whether the human-like "monsters" could have been part of the divine plan of creation. Saint Augustine was convinced that, provided they were indeed human beings, they had to have descended from Adam and Eve or from Noah's sons as legitimate images of God. The Bible doesn't say anything about how Noah divided the large cake called earth among his sons, but it is assumed that he gave the biggest and best piece to his firstborn son, Shem. The next best one went to Japheth and then all that was left for Ham, who had been cursed by his father, was Africa. In the clerical theory of descent, Ham thus became the progenitor of the Africans, condemned by his father to be his brothers' servant. Thus, the right to oppress and enslave was derived from the miracle of creation.
</p>
<p>
  Shonibare's approach to the hybrid creatures and projections of the Hereford Mappa Mundi is, again, that of playful parody. Conveniently, hybridity is essentially the defining feature of those living at the earth's edge. In the catalogue of origin myths and fictitious genealogies, they represent the radical and uncanny Other and thus reflect a massive Occidental ethnocentrism. Shonibare, however, converts this exclusion into elegant exclusivity by celebrating the peculiarity and eccentricity of those figments of the imagination and turns them into aliens fallen from the sky who, equipped with parachutes, float in the air or have already landed. Other-worldly creatures, they are oddballs in decorative surroundings who are appreciated and respected for their peculiarity. The brightly colourful textile works present a cheerful deconstruction and reversal of dark stereotypes. The 2019 exhibition <em>Creatures of the Mappa Mundi</em> shown at Hereford Cathedral is an impressive document of inclusion and emancipation, as Shonibare and his cooperation partners managed to get various local groups of marginalized people involved in the production of the truly wonderful creatures. In this way, a different story is told.

  To Explore: <em>End of Empire</em> by Yinka Shonibare CBE
</h3>
<p>
  <em>End of Empire</em> by Yinka Shonibare CBE is a striking work featuring two figures dressed in the artist&rsquo;s signature Dutch wax batik fabric, seated on a Victorian see-saw which slowly pivots in the space. This powerful imagery imitates the shifting points of balance in world politics over the course of World War I and the ensuing colonial fallout. The figures&rsquo; heads are replaced by globes, the maps depicting geopolitical borders as they were drawn in 1917. The bodies are clothed in Victorian suits, their colonial implications skewed by the brightly coloured fabric that, in Shonibare&rsquo;s own words, is &ldquo;Ethnisicing the Aristocracy&rdquo;. This is characteristic of the artist&rsquo;s engaged and critical approach, which uses appealing imagery and light-hearted insertions such as the see-saw to tackle important issues head on. First exhibited in 2016 at Turner Contemporary, Margate, UK, <em>End of Empire</em> was created by Shonibare as part of 14&ndash;18 NOW, a programme of World War I Centenary Art commissions to commemorate the First World War.

  Yinka Shonibare CBE RA was born in 1962 in London, UK. He studied Fine Art at Byam School of Art, London (now Central Saint Martins College) in 1989 and received his MFA from Goldsmiths, University of London in 1991. Shonibare&rsquo;s interdisciplinary practice uses citations of Western art history and literature to question the validity of contemporary cultural and national identities within the context of globalization. His trademark material is the brightly coloured Dutch wax batik fabric he buys in London. This fabric was inspired by Indonesian design, mass-produced by the Dutch and eventually sold to the colonies in West Africa. In the 1960s, the material became a new symbol of African identity and independence.

  To Watch: Wangechi Mutu and the Role of Artists and Art
</h3>
<p>
  In this course, we have "read" various art objects and monuments and considered how artists embed art with guidance for viewing and understanding. Art reveals where we came from, where we are at present, and where we are heading. For the penultimate monument of this course, we are examining the world of Wangechi Mutu. <a href="https://www.ted.com/speakers/wangechi_mutu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mutu's TED Talk profile</a> describes the visual artist:
</p>
<p>
  "In expansive work that incorporates painting, sculpture, collage, film, installation and performance art, Wangechi Mutu centers on the creation of hybrid creatures that explore themes of power, culture, femininity, colonial history and global consumption. Her art is often made of multiple materials, creating fantastical forms that evoke Afrofuturism and interspecies connections. Born in Nairobi, Kenya, Mutu has held various acclaimed museum and gallery shows around the world, exhibiting in cities including London, Hong Kong, Venice and Brussels. For her exhibition <em>The NewOnes, will free Us</em>, she installed four iconic bronze sculptures in front of The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. A solo show of new work opened at the New Museum in New York in March, 2023."
</p>
<p>
  Watch the following two videos to explore the role of artists and art in Wangechi Mutu's own words.
</p>

<h4>
  Art Term: Afrofuturism
</h4>
<p>
  Afrofuturism is a cultural aesthetic that combines science-fiction, history and fantasy to explore the African-American experience and aims to connect those from the black diaspora with their forgotten African ancestry. Refer to the <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/a/afrofuturism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tate's online glossary</a> for more.
</p>




<h4>
  Video: "Wangechi Mutu: I am Speaking, Are you Listening?"
</h4>
<p>
  Directed by Dawit N.M. and narrated by Mutu herself, the <a href="https://youtu.be/H4j0u9x1j2o?si=MBKQzDdmbMG_TIQX" target="_blank" rel="noopener">film &ldquo;I Am Speaking, Are you Listening?&rdquo; (09:30)</a> takes viewers on a journey of Mutu&rsquo;s work as it is dispersed throughout the Legion of Honor galleries. The film invites you Further consideration Mutu&rsquo;s belief of the artist as a healer and to reflect on art histories and the possibility of a world defined by care and protection of both people and the planet. As one of the commenters noted, Mutu briefly speaks Kikuyu, not Swahili in the video. Select "CC" in the video for closed captioning.

<h3>
  Reading: Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&rsquo;o on What It Means To Be Kenyan
</h3>



<p>
  Kọ́l&aacute; T&uacute;bọ̀s&uacute;n explores Kenyan identity with the celebrated author. Originally posted on <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/story/ng%C5%A9g%C4%A9-wa-thiong%E2%80%99o-on-what-it-means-to-be-kenyan/BQWRX_9H-dfvTQ?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Arts &amp; Culture</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&rsquo;o, born in January of 1938, is a foremost Kenyan writer, professor, and language activist &mdash; probably the best known Kenyan writer today. His renown, work, and activism has won him fans and several awards worldwide for his novels, plays, short stories, and essays.
</p>
<p>
  In 2016, his short story, Ituĩka Rĩa Mũrũngarũ: Kana Kĩrĩa Gĩtũmaga Andũ Mathiĩ Marũngiĩ (The Upright Revolution: Or Why Humans Walk Upright) became the most translated African short story, currently in over fifty languages. It was written originally in Kikuyu, the writer&rsquo;s first language&mdash;which all his stories since the seventies have been written in, before they get translated into other languages.
</p>
<p>
  I myself have translated the story into Yor&ugrave;b&aacute;, having met the writer at a literary festival in Abẹ́&ograve;kuta, Nigeria, in 2016. I have since collaborated with him on other projects enough to call him a mentor, father-figure, and friend. In this interview, I talk to him important cultural issues, his career, and Kenya, his native land.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>How would you describe "the people of Kenya" to someone who has never met them or even heard about the country?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Beautiful. Talented. Hardworking. Enterprising. The country is a vibrant space of the different cultural streams of African, Asian, and European origins. Its landscape and history have become part of the global imagination.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>What does "identity" mean to you?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Identity is an ever changing unity of difference and sameness; particularity and universality. Identity is the imagined container of multitudes. I am Gĩkũyũ, meaning I share a certain history with all who call themselves Gĩkũyũ, but I am also Kenyan, meaning I share a geographic and historical space with all other Kenyans. I am African. I am black. I&rsquo;m a citizen of the world.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>In which way has the notion of your identity changed over the years?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  It follows from the above that notions of identity, especially the name we give to it, change all the time. The particulars of experience change but the universal element of being, bound up in the particular, remains. Particularity is the form of being. Universality is the commonality of being. Identity is their unity.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>How has being part of the Kikuyu community influenced your life and outlook?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  I have shared my story in my memoirs: Dreams in a Time of War; In the House of the Interpreter; Birth of a Dreamweaver, and Wrestling with the Devil. I am still writing it through my actions. I was born in a home of four mothers, one father, and several siblings. My biological mother, Wanjikũ, is the most important influence on my life. She always wanted to know if I had tried my best, in whatever I did. But I am also a product of Gikuyu history and culture.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Today, 44 communities are officially registered by the Kenyan government and there are conversations about adding more to the list. Is there an object or a location that you consider to be a symbol of all these communities coming together?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  We are a people just like any other peoples of our globe. But as Kenyan peoples, we share a common history of struggle against colonialism. I grew up within the wider history of resistance to British colonial state, which, led by the Kenya Land and Freedom Army (the one the British misnamed Mau Mau) helped bring about our Independence in 1963. We share aspiration for a Kenya in which every child has access to adequate food, housing, education, and health.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>How would you define the identity of Kenya as a nation today?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The Kenyan identity is a work in progress. We struggle to be the best that Kenya can be. For this, we have to continue to struggle to secure our economic, political, and cultural base, all threatened by largely Western financial, and other, corporations. We have to continue to struggle against the gross social and income inequalities within our own country.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>What is your favourite saying in any Kenyan language and why?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Gũtirĩ ũtukũ ũtakĩa: &ldquo;There is no night so long that will not see the light of dawn.&rdquo; My mother, Wanjikũ, used to tell me this proverb. In times of challenges and adversity, I always recall the saying to instill in me resistance against succumbing to the negative. The saying is an expression of optimism.

<p>
  Take some time to closely look at and analyze Wangechi Mutu's <em>MamaRay</em> sculpture. What details do you notice first and why? Which angle(s) are you supposed to engage and interact with the sculpture? How did the Mutu use the elements of art and principles of design within the sculpture? After spending some time analyzing <em>MamaRay</em>, read the following excerpt from Margot Norton et al., <em>Wangechi Mutu: Intertwined</em> (London: Phaidon Press Limited, 2023).
