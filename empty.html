<h3>
  To Read: The Ultra Baroque Style of Churrigueresque
</h3><p>
  Term used from the late 18th century to denote the most exuberantly ornamental phase of Spanish architectural decoration, lasting from c. 1675 to c. 1750. The term derives from the Churriguera family family, the principal exponents of the style, who worked mostly in Salamanca. The origins of the style, however, can be traced back to the painter and sculptor Alonso Cano, who was a pioneering exponent of a highly ornamental style that began to characterize much Spanish art at the end of the 17th century. Most important in the propagation of the style were a number of sculptors, wood-carvers, cabinetmakers and carpenters who began to be highly influential in the field of architecture at this time, much to the chagrin of the more classically-minded specialist architects, such as Juan de Herrera. These sculptors and other craftsmen were chiefly responsible for the design and construction of the ephemeral structures built for coronations and other celebrations around this time. These were generally made of wood or cloth, allowing all manner of capricious and bizarre experiments with ornamentation. Some of these Baroque experiments were later taken up and applied in stucco or brick to such architectural elements as fa&ccedil;ades, walls, vaults, doors and cupolas and in sculptural ensembles such as retables, for example at the church of S Esteban, Salamanca.
</p>
<p>
  In the early 18th century the Churriguera family, together with such other artists as Pedro de Ribera in Madrid and Narciso Tom&eacute; in Toledo, took up this ornamental style and brought it to its logical conclusion, adding such new decorative elements as the est&iacute;pite (a tapering pilaster, shaped like an inverted pyramid and derived from Mannerist architecture) and solomonic (or spiral) columns. The est&iacute;pite was to become the dominant form. Tom&eacute;&rsquo;s designs were particularly ornamental and laden with sculptural decoration, including fluffy clouds and angels&rsquo; heads on column shafts, entablatures and cornices. The style also had its followers outside the central region of Spain. These included Figueroa, Leonardo de and his son Ambrosio de Figueroa (1700&ndash;50) in Seville, Francisco Hurtado Izquierdo and his group of followers in C&oacute;rdoba and Granada, and Domingo Antonio de Andrade (1639&ndash;1712) and Fernando de Casas y Novoa (both of whom worked on the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela) in Galicia. It was also subsequently introduced into Latin America, especially Mexico, by Jer&oacute;nimo de Balb&aacute;s, Lorenzo Rodr&iacute;guez and others. Although the late phase of the Churrigueresque coincided with the Rococo movement in Spain, the two styles should not be confused: while both styles were essentially decorative, using ornamentation to disguise weak architectural structure, Churrigueresque consisted in heavy, contorted decoration whereas Rococo was lighter and more curvaceous.

  <p>
    In 1630, the Dutch conquered the prosperous sugarcane-producing area in the northeast region of the Portuguese colony of Brazil. Although it only lasted for 24 years, the Dutch colony resulted in substantial art production. The governor Johan Maurits van Nassau-Siegen also encouraged scientific exploration and his palace in Mauritsstad (present-day Recife) included botanical gardens, a zoo, and a cabinet of curiosities. Maurits brought two artists, Albert Eckhout and the landscape painter Frans Post, to Brazil to document the local flora, fauna, people, and customs. One of Eckhout&rsquo;s series of eight paintings helps us to understand how the Dutch artist encoded ethnic differences among the colony&rsquo;s population.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Making Order of a Foreign World
  </h3>
  <p>
    Eckhout&rsquo;s series consists of four life-size male-female pairs, each representing a different cultural or ethnic category. Although Eckhout collaborated with scientists on other projects, these monumental oil paintings employ the visual language of fine art rather than of scientific illustration. The compositions and poses are based on European portrait conventions and some panels include mythological references.
  </p>
  <p>
    Eckhout may have used live models, and the level of detail gives the impression that these are portraits. However, they are meant to represent &ldquo;types&rdquo; rather than individuals. Much like New Spanish <em>casta</em> paintings, Eckhout conveys the moral and cultural stereotypes associated with each group. Clothing, jewelry, weapons, and baskets help to indicate the class and level of sophistication of the figures, while the proliferation of tropical fruits and vegetables advertises the natural abundance of the Brazilian land.

</p>
<p>
  Today, scientists recognize that the idea of separate human races is socially constructed rather than based in genetics. Although the classification of peoples into groups has a long history in Western art and science, skin color was not a major defining factor until around the middle of the seventeenth century&mdash;around the same time that Eckhout painted this series. Before this, ethnic groups were conceptualized based on cultural characteristics. For instance, the early 16th-century woodcuts of Hans Burgkmair differentiated the peoples of Africa and India by their hairstyles, material culture, and behaviors, but united all the figures with the same type of idealized body. Eckhout, on the other hand, pays careful attention to skin color and physiognomy as he categorizes the people of Brazil.
</p>
<p>
  Most scholars believe that these paintings were produced in Brazil to be hung in the governor&rsquo;s palace. They may have been arranged around a large room with other paintings by Eckhout, including a portrait of Johan Maurits and still life paintings of tropical fruits and vegetables. The series functioned as an extension of Maurits&rsquo;s cabinet of curiosities, enabling him to &ldquo;possess&rdquo; the portrayed figures. After the Dutch lost their Brazilian colony in 1654, Johan Maurits presented the paintings to the king of Denmark, as they had become unwelcome reminders of the failed colony.

  Of cannibals and converts

</p>
<p>
  The pair referred to as &ldquo;Tapuya&rdquo; represent native Brazilian tribes with whom Europeans were often engaged in battle. Their nudity, save for some leaves, strings, and small adornments, marks them as &ldquo;uncivilized&rdquo; in the eyes of the colonialists. The potential eroticism of the woman&rsquo;s nudity is undermined by the references to cannibalism&mdash;in addition to the severed limbs that she carries, the dog at her feet probably alludes to the dog-headed cannibals that the ancient Greeks described as living in distant regions of the world.<sup>1</sup> The Tapuyas&rsquo; militarism is highlighted by the man&rsquo;s weapons, as well as the distant group of armed figures behind the woman. The snake and spider at the man&rsquo;s feet further emphasize the threat that the Tapuya represented to the Dutch.

</p>
<p>
  In contrast to the Tapuya, the figures referred to as Brazilians are portrayed as having been tamed through their conversion to Christianity. Missionaries (Catholic under the Portuguese and Protestant under the Dutch) organized converted native Brazilians into aldeias (villages). The European-style building and tidy rows of trees in the orchard demonstrate European notions of the order that have been imposed on the Brazilian land. Both figures are partially clothed, and the woman&rsquo;s bare breasts emphasize her nurturing role as mother. Unlike the Tapuya man&rsquo;s club, the Brazilian man&rsquo;s bow and arrows, not unlike their European equivalents, are meant for hunting animals rather than humans.
</p>

<h3>
  Africans on either side of the Atlantic
</h3>
<p>
  Eckhout&rsquo;s African woman is shown as displaced from her homeland and forced into a world where Africans, Americans, and Europeans interacted. The American plants and native Brazilians fishing on the shore locate her in Brazil, but her hat and basket are African, while her jewelry and the pipe tucked into her waist are European. Although she probably represents a slave, the focus is not on labor but on her sexuality, as the child&rsquo;s ear of corn points toward her genitals. The child&rsquo;s lighter complexion may indicate that he is of mixed heritage: European men frequently had sexual relations, often coerced, with enslaved African women.
</p>
<p>
  The African man literally stands apart from the other figures. He is not situated in Brazil, but in Africa, as indicated by the date palm (which is native to North Africa) and the ivory tusk on the ground, which exemplifies Africa&rsquo;s trade goods. Although the sword, probably modeled after one in Johan Maurits&rsquo;s collection, is more appropriate to a nobleman, the loincloth, ivory tusk, and palm tree probably stem from prints of traders in the Guinea coast, a major slave trading region. This painting is likely intended to portray a merchant involved in the slave trade that brought the woman to Brazil. Both of these representations of African people emphasize their musculature, reinforcing the European conception that Africans were inherently suited to manual labor and, thus, suited to being enslaved.

</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>
  Between two worlds
</h3>
<p>
  The final pair of figures represents people of mixed race. The woman is a <em>mameluca</em>, of indigenous and white ancestry, and the man a <em>mulatto</em>, of black and white ancestry. The representation of the <em>mameluca</em> contains no references to agriculture or child-rearing. Instead, she solely provides voyeuristic pleasure to European males as she smiles cheekily at the viewer. The guinea pig reinforces her sexual availability because Europeans associated guinea pigs with rabbits, traditional symbols of fertility. To a European audience, the loose garment and flowers reference Flora, the Roman goddess of flowers and fertility who was adopted as a symbol for prostitutes and courtesans. In a place with few white women, the <em>mameluca</em>&rsquo;s whiteness made her particularly desirable as a concubine.
</p>
<p>
  In the eyes of Europeans, the so-called mulatto&rsquo;s white ancestry likewise allowed him to rise above other Afro-Brazilians. He is posed in an authoritative military stance in front of a sugarcane field, the Dutch colony&rsquo;s most important source of revenue. Likely tasked with protecting the fields and supervising the slaves, his appearance emphasizes his position within the social hierarchy between free and slave, European and non-European. His clothing is an imaginative mixture of European and foreign garments. While the offspring of enslaved women were born into slavery, children of white fathers were sometimes freed. Although bare feet can function as a visual symbol of enslavement, slaves were forbidden from carrying weapons&mdash;thus, the rifle and rapier suggest that he is free.

</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>
  White supremacy and exploitation
</h3>
<p>
  Eckhout may have intended to show the relative levels of &ldquo;civilization&rdquo; of the various types of peoples depicted in these paintings, but scholars disagree on the order of such a hierarchy. It is clear that Eckhout viewed the represented ethnic groups to be inferior to white Europeans. The careful attention granted to skin color and physiognomy suggests that Eckhout and his patron believed Europeans possessed not only superior culture and morals, but also biology. The paintings help to convey the message that Europeans had both a right and a duty to control and acculturate foreign peoples.
</p>
<p>
  The Dutch conquest of Brazil was economically motivated. These paintings accentuate the abundance and fertility of the Brazilian land, especially highlighting the lucrative sugarcane fields. The wealth generated by these endeavors, however, depended directly on the subjugation of both African and indigenous peoples. Eckhout&rsquo;s portrayals of the inhabitants of Brazil and Africa as inferior to Europeans served to justify and advocate for both the enslavement of Africans and the exploitation of the Brazilian land and its inhabitants.

<h3>
  To Consider: Collections and Colonialism
</h3>
<p>
  Earlier, we came across the term "cabinet of curiosities." Cabinets of curiosities, or <em>wunderkammern</em>, arose in mid-sixteenth-century Europe as repositories for all manner of wondrous and exotic objects. In essence, these collections&mdash;combining specimens, diagrams, and illustrations from many disciplines; marking the intersection of science and superstition; and drawing on natural, manmade, and artificial worlds&mdash;can be seen as the precursors to museums. But consider how such "wondrous and exotic" objects were selected, acquired, and collected. Who does the collecting and what is being collected? From cabinets of curiosities to museum collections, the desire for acquiring and owning "exotic" objects is a driving force of the colonial enterprise.
</p>
<p>
  Lynn Maranda, Curator Emerita of the Museum of Vancouver, wrote an article titled "Decolonization within the Museum" in 2021. Below is the introduction to the article. Interested in reading more? Visit the <a href="https://journals.openedition.org/iss/3863" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>ICOFOM Study Series </em>site</a> for the full text.
</p>
<p>
  The questions to be addressed are: why are museums seen as colonial spaces and why has a state of museum decolonization not yet been achieved? While Indigenous peoples are always "knocking" on the museum&rsquo;s door, museums are reluctant to reach out, to welcome, to share. What is behind all this and can a path forward be achieved?
</p>
<h3>
  The primary fact
</h3>
<p>
  The existence of the museum is, itself, a colonizing fact. The very structure and what it embodies is perhaps the epitome and certainly one of the most readily observable symbolic remnants from the age of "active" colonialism. Museums are a product of colonialization as they grew out of those Cabinets of Curiosities which were private assemblages of what were frequently classified as strange and unusual oddities often pillaged and brought back from foreign and exotic lands. Colonization and the "bring &rsquo;em back alive" mentality that all too often underpinned the growth of such collections, up to and including the advent of the museum, has deep roots and became firmly entrenched in "Western" and "Western-leaning" societies around the world.
</p>
<p>
  As a consequence, the ultimate reality of any decolonization achievement in this sphere would mean the entire physical destruction of museums and all for which they stand. As this is not likely to happen, what can be done to try to mitigate the over-bearing colonialization museums represent to so many, and especially to indigenous peoples worldwide? Another route, another mindset, another rethink, are required and this can only happen from within the museum itself and through the museum undertaking to transmit a new reality not only to itself, but also to its immediate community, to the world beyond, and even to the seats of national governance. Then, and only then, can museum become a standard-bearer for the decolonization of itself and for a societal realignment towards those who have been disenfranchised for so long.

    <strong>Curator Luis Perez-Oramas:</strong> <em>Abapor&uacute;</em>, a word constituted by two Tupi-Guarani words meaning "the man who eats human flesh," was painted by Tarsila in 1928 in order to be given as a birthday gift to her husband, Oswald de Andrade.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Artist Tarsila do Amaral (voiced by curator Karen Grimson):</strong> I wanted to make a picture that would startle Oswald, something really out of the ordinary. The <em>Abapor&uacute;</em> was that monstrous figure, the little head, the skinny little arm supported by an elbow, those enormous long legs, and next to it a cactus that looked like a sun, as if it were a flower and the sun at the same time. So, when he saw the picture, Oswald was extremely startled and asked, &ldquo;But what is this? What an extraordinary thing!&rdquo;
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Curator Luis Perez-Oramas:</strong> This painting actually became the signature illustration of the <em>Anthropophagic Manifesto</em> written by Oswald de Andrade. Anthropophagy, or cannibalistic practices, were documented among native Brazilians. In the 1920s avant-garde Paris, there was an obsession with cannibalistic practices from surrealist intellectuals and artists. Oswald took this motif of cannibalism to suggest symbolically ingesting artistic influences from both modern European art and traditional Brazilian culture. The aim was to produce a hybrid style that was distinctly new, and distinctly Brazilian.

  <stron&ldquo;Man Who Eats&rdquo;
  </h3
  <p>
    Brazilian artist Tarsila do Amaral painted <em>Abapor&uacute;</em> in her S&atilde;o Paulo studio early in 1928. It depicts a seated nude figure in profile who is of ambiguous age, gender, and race. His bare right foot and hand are firmly planted on the ground. His right knee is bent towards his chest, obscuring any view of a left leg or foot. His left elbow rests on the bent right knee, propping up a very small head. This figure is painted from an extremely low perspective, which causes his body to appear distorted. His right hand and foot are enormous, while his head and upper torso are quite small. The figure appears to be outdoors, sitting on a green surface from which rise a large cactus and a yellow sphere, against a blue background.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tarsila, as she is commonly known in Brazil, was one of the foremost painters of S&atilde;o Paulo&rsquo;s modernist movement in the first half of the twentieth century. She is best known for her innovative paintings of the 1920s, when she was actively engaged in the development of a new visual language of Brazilian modernism.
  </p>
  <p>
    In January of 1928, Tarsila presented <em>Abapor&uacute;</em> as a birthday gift to her husband, the writer and modernist theorizer Oswald de Andrade. By their own accounts, de Andrade was fascinated by the painting and proclaimed that he would make a movement around it. Consulting a seventeenth-century dictionary of Tupi-Guarani Indigenous languages written by the Jesuit missionary Antonio Ruiz de Montoya, Tarsila named the painting &ldquo;aba-poru,&rdquo; a combination of words that has been roughly translated to &ldquo;man who eats.&rdquo;
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Abapor&uacute;</em>, which is today in the collection of the Museum of Latin American Art in Buenos Aires (MALBA), has become an icon of twentieth-century Brazilian art. This is both because the painting employs unique visual strategies and also because it inspired the writing of one of the most important documents in Brazilian art of the twentieth century: the Manifesto Antrop&oacute;fago (Cannibalist Manifesto, 1928), written by de Andrade.

<h3>
  The <em>Cannibalist Manifesto</em>
  </h3
  <p>
    With the now famous phrase &ldquo;Tupi or not tupi, that is the question,&rdquo; de Andrade opens his <em>Cannibalist Manifesto</em> making a reference to Shakespeare&rsquo;s Hamlet while asking a question about Brazilian cultural identity. Tupi was one of the largest Indigenous linguistic groups in pre-conquest Brazil, encompassing many tribes that lived along the region&rsquo;s Atlantic coast. Some were said to practice ritual anthropophagy at times of war; practices that aroused the interest, and often imagination, of early European explorers and colonizers. Sixteenth- and seventeenth-century artists such as Theodor de Bry and Albert Eckhout explored the subject of anthropophagy in fantastical prints and paintings that depicted Indigenous Brazilians consuming or carrying severed limbs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Addressing this colonialist preoccupation with cannibalism, in his manifesto de Andrade employs the concept of anthropophagy as a metaphor for cultural consumption. He argues that artists should be free to cannibalize, or appropriate, the many cultural influences that surrounded them in modern Brazil&mdash;be they Indigenous, popular, or foreign. After a process of digestion, or synthesis, he believed this consumption would yield new cultural products, both original and genuinely Brazilian.
  </p>
  <p>
    The manifesto was published in the first issue of the <em>Revista de Antropofagia (Journal of Antropophagy)</em> in May, 1928. In its original publication, it was illustrated by a line drawing of Tarsila&rsquo;s <em>Abapor&uacute;</em>.

  Anthropophagy and Tarsila

<p>
  Approaching Tarsila&rsquo;s painting through de Andrade&rsquo;s theory reveals how the artist engaged multiple visual sources and reassigned meaning to the forms of European art. For example, art historian Michele Greet has argued that the figure&rsquo;s posture in Abapor&uacute; recalls that of Auguste Rodin&rsquo;s famous sculpture <em>The Thinker</em>&mdash;a large bronze sculpture of a heroic male nude shown in deep contemplation.
</p>
<p>
  As she notes, however, &ldquo;with its diminutive head, [<em>Abapor&uacute;</em>] subverts Rodin&rsquo;s emphasis on intellectual contemplation.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup> By distorting the body, Tarsila instead places our focus on the figure&rsquo;s enlarged limbs that, rather than resting on a pedestal, connect directly to the earth, perhaps suggesting that <em>Abapor&uacute;</em> is a creature rooted in Brazilian nature.
</p>
<p>
  Some of the techniques Tarsila employed in painting <em>Abapor&uacute;</em> were in dialogue with the works of French painter Fernand L&eacute;ger, with whom she had briefly studied in 1923. Between 1918&ndash;23, what has become known as his &ldquo;mechanical&rdquo; period, many of L&eacute;ger&rsquo;s paintings presented machine-like forms and tubular figures. In such paintings as <em>Three Women</em>, L&eacute;ger achieved a sense of volume in the human figures by creating dark shading contouring their rounded bodies. In <em>Abapor&uacute;</em>, Tarsila employs a similar technique. The figure&rsquo;s sinuous body is outlined in darker tones, and Tarsila&rsquo;s brushstrokes become lightest in color towards the middle of his right arm and foot. While L&eacute;ger often applied this technique to create sleek, curved bodies in relationship to gridded backgrounds that recall machine-made built environments, Tarsila brings this modernist style into conversation with Brazil&rsquo;s organic landscapes.

  Scholars have proposed a number of visual and literary sources Tarsila may have drawn upon in imagining <em>Abapor&uacute;</em>&rsquo;s distorted form. Art historians Carol Damian and Regina Teixeira de Barros, for instance, have suggested that the figure&rsquo;s enlarged single foot may reference mythological creatures called sciapods.<sup>2</sup> Accounts by ancient Greek authors described sciapods as small men said to live in hot climates, who had only one leg and could use their giant foot to shade themselves from the sun, such as we see represented in a woodcut in the <em>Nuremberg Chronicle</em>.
</p>
<p>
  Other scholars have noted shared concerns between Tarsila&rsquo;s image and works by surrealist artists working in Europe in the 1920s. Greet, for example, pointed out the &ldquo;visual affinity&rdquo; between <em>Abapor&uacute;</em> and Joan Mir&oacute;&rsquo;s <em>Person Throwing a Stone at a Bird</em>, painted just two years earlier, in 1926.<sup>3</sup> In both paintings, large swaths of color define the flattened background and foreground of landscapes inhabited by a single abstracted figure, each with a prominent, oversized foot.
</p>
<p>
  These are only a few examples of the ways in which Tarsila applied the strategies of Anthropophagy in painting <em>Abapor&uacute;</em>, as she consumed and synthesized a wide network of visual and cultural sources from Brazil and Europe. In doing so, Tarsila established her own knowledge and mastery of international modernist forms while putting forward a wholly original work informed by her perspective as a Brazilian artist.
</p>
<h3>
  Abapor&uacute; and Brazilian modernism
</h3>
<p>
  In the 1920s, artists across Brazil began exploring modernism as a means to reject the strict Academic system that had dominated national artistic production since the early nineteenth century. Artists like Tarsila had travelled to Europe and experienced different avant-garde movements that were already underway there, such as Cubism, Fauvism, and German Expressionism. Convening in large urban centers such as S&atilde;o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, and Recife, they developed their own modernist languages that significantly altered the landscape of Brazilian art.
</p>
<p>
  <em>The Cannibalist Manifesto</em> aimed to present a strategy for producing artworks that were both original to Brazil and engaged with these broader international discourses. The theories of the Cannibalist Manifesto and the visual strategies that Tarsila employed in <em>Abapor&uacute;</em> provide crucial models for us to study the transnational dialogues artists were engaged in, which propelled the development of new forms of art throughout the twentieth century.

  To Compare: Representing Identities and Cultures
</h3>
<p>
  Over the past six weeks, we have explored several objects from various parts of the world. How do artists represent identities and cultures, either their own or another's? What is the role of art objects in documenting and propagating ideas, values, biases, and aspirations? What assumptions are you making as a viewer? What are our responsibilities as viewers when engaging with such objects? What questions should we ask and how do we meaningfully interact with these objects in 2023?
