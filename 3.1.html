        So far, we've been closely looking and analyzing the formal elements of art objects. Now we will explore the historical aspects of the object and consider how we can conduct research about such an object.

        The video below, by Youtuber BadEmpanada, offers some excellent general considerations for conducting history research. Important moments of the video are listed below.

        Drafting Research Questions: Contextual Analysis
      </h3>
      
      <div class="pad" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
        <p>
          While formal analysis through careful looking is one of the two basic tools of art history, the other basic tool of art history is contextual analysis through research. When you undertake a contextual analysis, you&rsquo;re trying to understand the work of art in a particular cultural moment. A focus on context gradually enlarges our view and expands what our scholarship should encompass. This can mean focusing on the work of art as it exists today, or on the work of art in its own time or at another point in history. It can also mean looking at the social, political, spiritual, and/or economic significance of the work.
        </p>
        <p>
          People often talk about art &ldquo;in context,&rdquo; but that isn&rsquo;t a very satisfactory approach in some ways. It suggests that context (culture) is already all set without the work of art as if the work of art has no effect on individuals or society. Of course, if it were true that visual images don&rsquo;t have any effect on people, then there wouldn&rsquo;t be any advertising on TV or in magazines!
        </p>
        <p>
          To think of a work of art &ldquo;as&rdquo; social context rather than &ldquo;in&rdquo; social context means recognizing it as something that has an effect on people, on how they think and feel and act, and on larger social processes-how groups of people think and feel and act. Works of art and social context are often thought of as mutually constituting, that is, having an effect on each other. Works of art are shaped by historical processes, which are in turn shaped by works of art in continual interaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following are some basic questions to ask in developing a contextual analysis. Not every question is applicable to every object. For example, if you don&rsquo;t know the artist&rsquo;s identity, for whatever reason, then there are a number of questions that you can&rsquo;t ask about the creation of the work. You can also use Professor Cohen's SIAPFAR (style, iconography, artist, patron, function, audience, reception) method (explored in the first tutorial) for brainstorming questions.

        For me, the process of interpreting a work of art from another culture or from the past is like speaking a foreign language. I may not speak a language well, and may not fully understand what native speakers are saying, but a great deal of successful communication is still possible, despite my imperfect grammar and vocabulary. So, too, with a work of art. You may not grasp all of its meaning&mdash;if that&rsquo;s even possible, given the variable understandings and interpretations of the very people who made and used the work&mdash;but there is much that you can know and understand. Your tools are contextual and formal analysis.

        Exploring Art History Research Sources
      </h3>
      <p>
        Now that you have drafted some research questions, you can begin to identify relevant research sources. Below are four types of sources often used in art history research. Research is a skill that requires patience and practice to develop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: Reference librarians, especially those who specialize in art history, are excellent resources. At the University of Toronto, <a href="https://arthistory.utoronto.ca/news/profile-art-history-librarian-margaret-english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Margaret English</a> is the subject-specialist librarian for Art History and Visual Studies. If you ever need to write an art history research paper, bring an outline of your paper or your ideas along with a list of the bibliographic references you already have, and ask for suggestions.

        <p>
          Scholarly sources are written by academics and other experts and contribute to knowledge in a particular field by sharing new research findings, theories, analyses, insights, news, or summaries of current knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scholarly sources can be either <a href="https://onesearch.library.utoronto.ca/faq/how-do-i-find-primary-sources-humanities-student" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary</a> or <a href="https://onesearch.library.utoronto.ca/faq/what-are-secondary-sources" target="_blank" rel="noopener">secondary</a> research. They can also come in many different formats. Books, articles, and websites can all be scholarly. Remember, there is sometimes a <a href="https://onesearch.library.utoronto.ca/faq/whats-difference-between-scholarly-and-peer-reviewed-articles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">difference between scholarly and peer-reviewed articles</a>; all peer-reviewed sources are scholarly, but not all scholarly sources are peer-reviewed.

        <p>
          A common question when engaging with scholarly sources is "How many sources should I use?" There is no simple answer to this question. Different topics will generate bibliographies of different lengths. For some topics, there are lots of sources; for others, few. Some approaches to a subject will require more sources than others. What this question is really asking is &ldquo;Have I done enough research?&rdquo; The answer to that question, of course, lies in the quality of the paper you produce. With experience, you will learn when you have done enough research to develop a thoughtful and original interpretation of your subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instructors sometimes specify a minimum number of sources to help guide beginning researchers in their work.

        Why do we cite?
      </h3>
      
      <p>
        Now that we've drafted research questions, identified art history research sources, and evaluated scholarly sources, it is time to cite our sources! The following information is adapted from the University of Toronto Libraries' <a href="https://guides.library.utoronto.ca/citing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Citing Sources / Create Your Bibliography" page</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although we may casually share clips of content with friends in our online world, this doesn't apply to serious academic inquiry. Giving credit at every opportunity to the work of others in academic writing is essential to show how we develop arguments and viewpoints. Because we build on the work of others in order to form new knowledge, we must cite the work that came before us to help readers understand how we reached our conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not every statement in your writing needs to be cited. Every discipline has a generally accepted definition of what is considered "common knowledge" in that discipline, and those statements need not be attached to a citation. Below are some examples of common knowledge that <strong>do not</strong> typically need to be cited.
      </p>
      
      
      <ul class="boxList gridCols">
        <li>
          If it's a well known fact
          <cite>
            E.g. "Hokusai is a Japanese artist who is known for The Great Wave."
          </cite>
        </li>
        <li>
          If it can be found in at least five different sources
        </li>
        <li>
          If it is widely known by people in your field
          <cite>
            E.g. "The Great Wave is a woodblock print on paper." 
          </cite>
        </li>
        <li>
          If it's a historical fact
          <cite>
            E.g. "The Edo period lasted from 1603 to 1868."
          </cite>
        </li>
        <li>
          If it's a geographical location
          <cite>
            E.g. "Mount Fuji is located on the Japanese island of Honshu"
          </cite>
        </li>
        <li class="inv" style="border: none;">
          <p>
            Of course, it's not always clear whether something counts as common knowledge, according to these criteria. If you're unsure, it's always safer to cite it:
          </p>
          <h5 style="margin: 0;">
            When in doubt, cite!

          <p>
            Refer to the hyperlinks below for instructions on how to insert footnotes. Footnotes come after punctuations (either a comma or a period). One footnote can refer to multiple sources. There is no need to indent the footnotes (as seen in numerous examples online). In our course, footnotes should be in Calibri font, size 10 (slightly smaller than the body text), and single-spaced. Use an en dash (&ndash;) for page ranges.

        Books
      </h4>
      <p>
        There is an enormous literature in art history, and it may at times be overwhelming to try to make your way through it as you work on your paper. Because there is so much popular publishing about art, you want to be careful to evaluate your sources for their quality and relevance to your work. Although it is not an absolute guarantee of scholarly merit, look for exhibition catalogues published by major museums and books published by university presses. These have the highest scholarly standards and the most rigorous editorial process and so will probably be the best resources for your work.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no absolute standard cut-off for the dates of your sources or how old they are. There are classic works that still contain many insights that are forty or so years old&mdash;or even older. One general guideline for the quality of an older publication is to see how often it is cited. If you see it in lots of bibliographies, then you should probably take a look at it too. It is also absolutely essential to consult the most recent scholarship on a subject. If you are unsure about the scholarly merit of a book, you have several options. You can, of course, ask your instructor or a research librarian about it. You may also want to look up reviews of the work in major journals. I recommend looking up more than one review&mdash;you don't want your perspective on the book skewed by reading one review that happens to be unusually hostile or positive.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you research, it is important to keep in mind the distinction between primary and <a href="https://onesearch.library.utoronto.ca/faq/what-are-secondary-sources" target="_blank">secondary sources</a>, because each gives you different kinds of information on your subject. Primary sources for historical research are those sources produced by people directly involved in the images, events, and period you are writing about. So, for example, the letters of Mary Cassatt (1845&ndash;1926) are a primary source for understanding her art. Secondary sources are by scholars and others commenting on or interpreting the images, events, and period you're writing about. The art historian Griselda Pollock's book <em>Mary Cassatt: Painter of Modern Women</em> (London: Thames and Hudson, 1998) is a secondary source about the artist. Many primary sources have been published&mdash;artists' letters and other writings, for example&mdash;and so will be readily available to you. Other primary sources are unpublished and will be inaccessible without going to the libraries, museums, and archives that house the original items. Instructors typically don't expect undergraduates to utilize unpublished primary sources in their research papers.

        There are many types of specialized publications within art history. These are a few that you may run across:

      <h4>Specialized Art-History Publications</h4>
      
      <ul class="gridCols boxList">
        <li>
          <h5>Exhibition catalogue</h5>
          <p>
            Catalogues often contain recent scholarship in the form of essays by leading scholars in the field. Over the past 20 years or so, exhibition catalogues produced by major museums have become important works of scholarship.
          </p>    
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <h5>Monograph</h5>
          <p>
            This type of book focuses on a single subject or on the work of a single artist.
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <h5>Catalogue raisonn&eacute;</h5>
          <p>
            The complete catalogue of an artist's work, often including extensive entries on each work, tracing its collection history (provenance) and commenting on its significance.
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <h5>Festschrift</h5>
          <p>
            This German word meaning "festival writing" is used for a collection of essays celebrating a distinguished scholar (often upon retiring). Colleagues and students contribute essays that typically address or were inspired by the dedicatee's work.
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <h5>Corpus</h5>
          <p>
            This term (pl. corpora) comes from the Latin term for "body." A corpus publishes all the objects of a known type. One of the best known is the <em>Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum</em>, a multi-volume work that publishes images and catalogue information for all the known ancient Greek painted vases.

        Periodicals
      </h4>
      <p>
        Periodical literature is important because this is often where scholars publish new ideas first. As with books, there are so many periodical publications on art that sorting them out can be a bewildering process. Glossy art magazines geared toward collectors, dealers, and interior designers are often very appealing, but they are typically written by professional journalists rather than art historians and so are somewhat limited as scholarly resources. While such periodicals can be useful (especially if you are writing about collecting practices, for example), your best bet is to work with scholarly journals for most subjects. Some of the most important scholarly journals in art history are listed below; these are the journals to consult first. These journals have a demanding review process for all the articles they publish and their authors are usually highly trained art historians.

        Websites
      </h4>
      <p>
        A note of caution: The internet offers a lot of good material you may not find elsewhere, but you need to select very carefully. Remember, just about anyone can make a website. Not all the art-history information you will find on the internet, even on useful reference sites, will be accurate and up-to-date. In general, websites developed by museums, libraries, and universities are the more reliable resources&mdash;although, like any other source, the information they provide must be critically evaluated. Be skeptical of anything posted by an individual, unless you can verify that that person has credentials that make him or her a recognized authority on art history (such as a Ph.D. from a reputable university, a teaching position, a museum position, or a staff position at a major periodical).
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember, too, that you will not be able to write an entire paper from research conducted exclusively on the Internet. There is a tremendous amount of valuable scholarly material that has not been put up on the web, and it may be years before this material is available online.

        The <a href="https://guides.library.utoronto.ca/art" target="_blank">University of Toronto Art History Research Guide</a> lists a number of art-history reference works that may help you in your research. Dictionaries of artists or of symbols and subjects in art can be very helpful as you begin your research. I want to mention in particular <a href="http://www.oxfordartonline.com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">Oxford Art Online</a>, which is an excellent resource, with articles written by major scholars in the field.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep in mind that references like the Encyclopedia Britannica are not usually acceptable resources for a university-level research paper because the articles are usually too general. You should feel free to consult a general encyclopedia if you need some background information on a particular topic. Your paper should be specific enough in its arguments, so the kind of material presented in a general encyclopedia is not something that you would need to quote.
