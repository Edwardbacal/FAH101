        Getting Started with Art History Research
      </h3>      
      <p>
        So far, we've been closely looking and analyzing the formal elements of art objects. Now we will explore the historical aspects of the object and consider how we can conduct research about such an object.

      <p>
        The video below, by Youtuber BadEmpanada, offers some excellent general considerations for conducting history research. Important moments of the video are listed below. You might find it helpful to use some of the questions presented in the video to guide your evaluation of research sources.

        Drafting Research Questions: Contextual Analysis
      </h3>
      
      <div class="pad" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
        <p>
          While formal analysis through careful looking is one of the two basic tools of art history, the other basic tool of art history is contextual analysis through research. When you undertake a contextual analysis, you&rsquo;re trying to understand the work of art in a particular cultural moment. A focus on context gradually enlarges our view and expands what our scholarship should encompass. This can mean focusing on the work of art as it exists today, or on the work of art in its own time or at another point in history. It can also mean looking at the social, political, spiritual, and/or economic significance of the work.
        </p>
        <p>
          People often talk about art &ldquo;in context,&rdquo; but that isn&rsquo;t a very satisfactory approach in some ways. It suggests that context (culture) is already all set without the work of art as if the work of art has no effect on individuals or society. Of course, if it were true that visual images don&rsquo;t have any effect on people, then there wouldn&rsquo;t be any advertising on TV or in magazines!
        </p>
        <p>
          To think of a work of art &ldquo;as&rdquo; social context rather than &ldquo;in&rdquo; social context means recognizing it as something that has an effect on people, on how they think and feel and act, and on larger social processes-how groups of people think and feel and act. Works of art and social context are often thought of as mutually constituting, that is, having an effect on each other. Works of art are shaped by historical processes, which are in turn shaped by works of art in continual interaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following are some basic questions to ask in developing a contextual analysis. Not every question is applicable to every object. For example, if you don&rsquo;t know the artist&rsquo;s identity, for whatever reason, then there are a number of questions that you can&rsquo;t ask about the creation of the work. You can also use Professor Cohen's SIAPFAR (style, iconography, artist, patron, function, audience, reception) method (explored in the first tutorial) for brainstorming questions.

        For me, the process of interpreting a work of art from another culture or from the past is like speaking a foreign language. I may not speak a language well, and may not fully understand what native speakers are saying, but a great deal of successful communication is still possible, despite my imperfect grammar and vocabulary. So, too, with a work of art. You may not grasp all of its meaning&mdash;if that&rsquo;s even possible, given the variable understandings and interpretations of the very people who made and used the work&mdash;but there is much that you can know and understand. Your tools are contextual and formal analysis.
