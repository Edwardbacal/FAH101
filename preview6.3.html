        Wangechi Mutu and the Role of Artists and Art
      </h3>
      <p>
        In this course, we have "read" various art objects and monuments and considered how artists embed art with guidance for viewing and understanding. Art reveals where we came from, where we are at present, and where we are heading. For the penultimate monument of this course, we are examining the world of Wangechi Mutu. <a href="https://www.ted.com/speakers/wangechi_mutu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mutu's TED Talk profile</a> describes the visual artist:
      </p>
      <blockquote><span></span><div>
        <p>
          "In expansive work that incorporates painting, sculpture, collage, film, installation and performance art, Wangechi Mutu centers on the creation of hybrid creatures that explore themes of power, culture, femininity, colonial history and global consumption. Her art is often made of multiple materials, creating fantastical forms that evoke Afrofuturism and interspecies connections. Born in Nairobi, Kenya, Mutu has held various acclaimed museum and gallery shows around the world, exhibiting in cities including London, Hong Kong, Venice and Brussels. For her exhibition <em>The NewOnes, will free Us</em>, she installed four iconic bronze sculptures in front of The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. A solo show of new work opened at the New Museum in New York in March, 2023."

        <h4>
          Art Term: Afrofuturism
        </h4>
        <p>
          Afrofuturism is a cultural aesthetic that combines science-fiction, history and fantasy to explore the African-American experience and aims to connect those from the black diaspora with their forgotten African ancestry. Refer to the <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/a/afrofuturism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tate's online glossary</a> for more.

        Watch the following two videos to explore the role of artists and art in Wangechi Mutu's own words.
      </h5>
      
      <p>
        In the first video, "I Am Speaking, Are you Listening?", directed by Dawit N.M. and narrated by Mutu herself, the film takes viewers on a journey of Mutu&rsquo;s work as it is dispersed throughout the Legion of Honor galleries. The film invites you Further consideration Mutu&rsquo;s belief of the artist as a healer and to reflect on art histories and the possibility of a world defined by care and protection of both people and the planet. As one of the commenters noted, Mutu briefly speaks Kikuyu, not Swahili in the video.

        The next video is a TED talk starring Mutu.
        Using found materials and mesmerizing structures that unearth deep-rooted emotions, her visual creations celebrate our collective history and explore how art communicates into the future. From ancient rock carvings in the Sahel to her own chimeric abstractions, the artist shares her journey of self-discovery and reminds us all that we already speak the most ancient language of all.

        In the interview below, Nigerian linguist and writer K·ªçÃÅl&aacute; T&uacute;b·ªçÃÄs&uacute;n explores Kenyan identity with the celebrated author Ng≈©gƒ© wa Thiong&rsquo;o. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Portrait of Ngugi wa Thiong'o, from the collection of Steve Biko Foundation.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Ng≈©gƒ© wa Thiong&rsquo;o, born in January of 1938, is a foremost Kenyan writer, professor, and language activist &mdash; probably the best known Kenyan writer today. His renown, work, and activism has won him fans and several awards worldwide for his novels, plays, short stories, and essays.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2016, his short story, Ituƒ©ka Rƒ©a M≈©r≈©ngar≈©: Kana Kƒ©rƒ©a Gƒ©t≈©maga And≈© Mathiƒ© Mar≈©ngiƒ© (The Upright Revolution: Or Why Humans Walk Upright) became the most translated African short story, currently in over fifty languages. It was written originally in Kikuyu, the writer&rsquo;s first language&mdash;which all his stories since the seventies have been written in, before they get translated into other languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      I myself have translated the story into Yor&ugrave;b&aacute;, having met the writer at a literary festival in Ab·∫πÃÅ&ograve;kuta, Nigeria, in 2016. I have since collaborated with him on other projects enough to call him a mentor, father-figure, and friend. In this interview, I talk to him important cultural issues, his career, and Kenya, his native land.
    </p>
    
    
    <h5 style="margin: 4rem 0 -1rem 0">
      How would you describe "the people of Kenya" to someone who has never met them or even heard about the country?
    </h5>
    <blockquote><span></span><div>
      <p>
        Beautiful. Talented. Hardworking. Enterprising. The country is a vibrant space of the different cultural streams of African, Asian, and European origins. Its landscape and history have become part of the global imagination.
      </p>
    </div></blockquote>
    
    <h5 style="margin: 4rem 0 -1rem 0">
      What does "identity" mean to you?
    </h5>
    <blockquote><span></span><div>
      <p>
        Identity is an ever changing unity of difference and sameness; particularity and universality. Identity is the imagined container of multitudes. I am Gƒ©k≈©y≈©, meaning I share a certain history with all who call themselves Gƒ©k≈©y≈©, but I am also Kenyan, meaning I share a geographic and historical space with all other Kenyans. I am African. I am black. I&rsquo;m a citizen of the world.
      </p>
    </div></blockquote>
    <h5 style="margin: 4rem 0 -1rem 0">
      In which way has the notion of your identity changed over the years?
    </h5>
    <blockquote><span></span><div>
      <p>
        It follows from the above that notions of identity, especially the name we give to it, change all the time. The particulars of experience change but the universal element of being, bound up in the particular, remains. Particularity is the form of being. Universality is the commonality of being. Identity is their unity.
      </p>
    </div></blockquote>
    <h5 style="margin: 4rem 0 -1rem 0">
      How has being part of the Kikuyu community influenced your life and outlook?
    </h5>
    <blockquote><span></span><div>
      <p>
        I have shared my story in my memoirs: Dreams in a Time of War; In the House of the Interpreter; Birth of a Dreamweaver, and Wrestling with the Devil. I am still writing it through my actions. I was born in a home of four mothers, one father, and several siblings. My biological mother, Wanjik≈©, is the most important influence on my life. She always wanted to know if I had tried my best, in whatever I did. But I am also a product of Gikuyu history and culture.
      </p>
    </div></blockquote>
    
    <h5 style="margin: 4rem 0 -1rem 0">
      Today, 44 communities are officially registered by the Kenyan government and there are conversations about adding more to the list. Is there an object or a location that you consider to be a symbol of all these communities coming together?
    </h5>
    <blockquote><span></span><div>
      <p>
        We are a people just like any other peoples of our globe. But as Kenyan peoples, we share a common history of struggle against colonialism. I grew up within the wider history of resistance to British colonial state, which, led by the Kenya Land and Freedom Army (the one the British misnamed Mau Mau) helped bring about our Independence in 1963. We share aspiration for a Kenya in which every child has access to adequate food, housing, education, and health.
      </p>
    </div></blockquote>
    <h5 style="margin: 4rem 0 -1rem 0">
      How would you define the identity of Kenya as a nation today?
    </h5>
    <blockquote><span></span><div>
      <p>
        The Kenyan identity is a work in progress. We struggle to be the best that Kenya can be. For this, we have to continue to struggle to secure our economic, political, and cultural base, all threatened by largely Western financial, and other, corporations. We have to continue to struggle against the gross social and income inequalities within our own country.
      </p>
    </div></blockquote>
    <h5 style="margin: 4rem 0 -1rem 0">
      What is your favourite saying in any Kenyan language and why?
    </h5>
    <blockquote><span></span><div>
      <p>
        G≈©tirƒ© ≈©tuk≈© ≈©takƒ©a: &ldquo;There is no night so long that will not see the light of dawn.&rdquo; My mother, Wanjik≈©, used to tell me this proverb. In times of challenges and adversity, I always recall the saying to instill in me resistance against succumbing to the negative. The saying is an expression of optimism.

        Take some time to closely look at and analyze Wangechi Mutu's <em>MamaRay</em> sculpture. What details do you notice first and why? Which angle(s) are you supposed to engage and interact with the sculpture? How did the Mutu use the elements of art and principles of design within the sculpture? After spending some time analyzing <em>MamaRay</em>, read the following excerpt from Margot Norton et al., <em>Wangechi Mutu: Intertwined</em> (London: Phaidon Press Limited, 2023).
